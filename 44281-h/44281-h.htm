<p class="indent">The elder of these two brothers, William
Dunlop, was born at Greenock, Scotland, in
1792, and became, when a stripling of scarce
21 years of age, a surgeon in the famous
88th, or, Connaught Rangers. Being ordered
to Canada, where the war with the United
States was in progress, he made his way to
the fighting line in the Niagara Peninsula,
and there, serving first as surgeon and afterwards
as a combatant, he gave indubitable
proofs of courage and capacity. When the
"appalling intelligence" of the peace concluded
by the Treaty of Ghent reached him,
Dunlop embarked with his regiment for
England, just missing by a few days a share
in the glorious action of Waterloo, and was
ordered to India. While there his restless
activity occupied itself with his medical and
military duties, with the congenial task of
editing a newspaper, and with numerous
tiger hunts. So successful was he as a slayer
of tigers that he earned the name of
"Tiger" Dunlop, and in his later Canadian
days was familiarly known as "The Tiger."
An attack of jungle fever drove him back to
England on half-pay, and settling in London
he lived for a few years what has been called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagex" id="pagex"></a>[pg&nbsp;x]</span>
a most miscellaneous life. He wrote articles
for the magazines. He edited for a
time a newspaper called the "British Press,"
until he quarrelled with the publisher for
dismissing contemptuously a political upheaval
in France in the following brief
"leader": "We perceive that there is a
change of ministry in France;&mdash;we have
heard of no earthquakes in consequence!"
He edited a work on medical jurisprudence.
He started a Sunday newspaper for Anglo-Indians
called "The Telescope," the history
of which, declared one of his friends, was a
comedy of the drollest kind. He founded a
club,&mdash;being of convivial tastes and a prince
of boon companions,&mdash;called The Pig
and Whistle. Finally,&mdash;and this doubtless
led to his returning to Canada,&mdash;he
became interested, as secretary, or,
director, in some industrial concerns,
notably a salt works in Cheshire. In
London he made the acquaintance of Mr.
John Galt, and accompanied him to Canada
in 1826. He received from the Canada
Company the appointment of Warden of the
Forests, and for twenty years was a leading
figure in what we now call Western Ontario.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexi" id="pagexi"></a>[pg&nbsp;xi]</span>
If one wishes to know "The Tiger" in
this period, he must be sought in the charming
pages of the Misses Lizars&#39; book "In the
Days of the Canada Company." There, his
rollicking humour, his broad sympathies,
his eccentric jests are excellently depicted.
Dunlop represented Huron in Parliament,
where he was a veritable "enfant terrible,"
speaking his mind in his slap dash way and
frequently convulsing the House with merriment.
The story of his tossing the coin
with his brother to settle which of them
should marry Lou McColl, the Highland
housekeeper and devoted friend, and the
terms of his extraordinary will and testament,&mdash;one
clause of which (typical of all)
leaves some property to a sister "because
she is married to a minister whom (God
help him) she henpecks",&mdash;are famous. Dunlop&#39;s
literary talents were considerable. He
wearied of writing as he did of most things
that demanded continuous application. But
he had an easy style, much shrewd wit, and
undoubted ability. These qualities he displayed
in his magazine articles, in his book
"The Backwoodsman," and in the "Recollections,"
which are here reprinted from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexii" id="pagexii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xii]</span>
"The Literary Garland," the Montreal periodical
of half a century or more ago. They
were penned long after the events concerned
had occurred and it may be supposed that
he fell into some errors of fact. But as a
picture of the manner in which this haphazard
war was conducted it is singularly
vivid and impressive. The unearthing of
manuscripts and official documents about
this war will not throw into clearer relief
than the following pages do, the desperate
circumstances under which a mere
handful of French Canadian and Loyalist
colonists emerged from their primitive
villages and log cabins and with Spartan
courage and hardihood drove back the invader
again and again and captured large
areas of his territory. There are several
readable sketches of these campaigns, but
none with the freshness and spirit of Dunlop&#39;s.
In this lies its value and the justification
for preserving it. Dunlop retired from
Parliament in 1846, and was appointed Superintendent
of the Lachine Canal. He died
in the village of Lachine in the Autumn of
1848, and his body was conveyed to its
resting place at Goderich.</p>

<h2><a name="page1" id="page1"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p class="indent">The favourable reception of a small work on
this colony has emboldened me again to come before
the public in the character of an author, and
as it is fifteen years since I last obtruded myself
in that capacity, I have at least to boast of the
merit assumed to himself by the sailor in his
prayer, during a hurricane, "Thou knowest it is
seldom that I trouble thee," and I may hope on
the same grounds to be listened to.</p>

<p class="indent">It is now upwards of thirty-three years since I
became acquainted with this country, of which
I was eleven years absent. During that time I
visited the other quarters of the globe. My design
in this work is to shew the almost incredible
improvement that has taken place during
that period. Notwithstanding all that has been
written by tourists, &amp;c., very little indeed is
known of the value and capabilities of Canada,
as a colony, by the people of Great Britain.</p>

<p class="indent">I have not arrived at anything like methodical
arrangement further than stating in their chronological
order, events and scenes of which I was
a witness, with occasional anecdotes of parties
therein concerned, so that those who do not approve
of such a desultory mode of composition,
need not, after this fore-warning, read any further.
<a name="page2" id="page2"></a>
My intention, in fact, is not exclusively either to
instruct or amuse, but, if I possibly can accomplish
it, to do a little of both. I wish to give an
account of the effect of the changes that have
taken place in my day in the colony, on my own
feelings, rather than to enter into any philosophical
enquiry into their causes; and if in this
attempt I should sometimes degenerate into
what my late lamented friend, the Ettrick Shepherd,
would have denominated <i>havers</i>, I hope you
will remember that this is an infirmity to which
even Homer (see Horace,) is liable; and if, like
hereditary disease, it is a proof of paternity,
every author in verse or prose who has written
since his day, has ample grounds whereon to
found its pretensions to a most ancient and honourable
descent.</p>

AMERICAN WAR</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="center">"My native land, good night."&mdash;<i>Byron.</i></p>

<p class="indent">The end of March or the beginning of April,
1813, found me at the Army Depôt in the Isle of
Wight. Sir Walter Scott in his Surgeon&#39;s Daughter,
says that no one who has ever visited that
delightful spot can ever forget it, and I fully
agree with him, but though perfectly susceptible
of the impressions which its numberless beauties
leave on the mind, I must confess that the view
of a fleet of transports rounding St. Helens to
take us to our destination, would have been considered
by myself and my comrades, as a pleasanter
prospect than all Hampshire could offer to
our admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">I shall not stay to describe the state of military
society in those days at the Army Depôt at
Parkhurst barracks and the neighbouring town of
Newport. It has been much better done than I
could expect to do, by Major Spencer Muggridge,
in Blackwood&#39;s Magazine; all I can do as a subaltern,
is fully to endorse the field officer&#39;s statement,
and to declare that it is a just, graphic and
by no means over-charged description.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
I went once, and only once, to the Garrison
Mess, in company with two or three officers of
my acquaintance, and saw among other novelties
of a mess table, one officer <i>shy</i> a leg of mutton
at another&#39;s head, from one end of the table to
the other. This we took as notice to quit; so we
made our retreat in good order, and never again
returned, or associated with a set of gentlemen
who had such a vivacious mode of expressing a
difference of opinion.</p>

<p class="indent">The fact is, all the worse characters in the
army were congregated at the Isle of Wight;
men who were afraid to join their regiments
from the indifferent estimation they were held in
by their brother officers. These stuck to the
depôt, and the arrival of a fleet of transports at
Spithead or the Mother-bank, was a signal for a
general sickness among these worthies. And
this was peculiarly the case with those who were
bound for Canada, for they knew full well if they
could shirk past the month of August, there was
no chance of a call on their services until the
month of April following. And many scamps
took advantage of this. I know one fellow who
managed to avoid joining his regiment abroad for
no less than three years.</p>

<p class="indent">I took my departure from this military paradise
for the first time, for this country, in the
beginning of August, 1813, in a small, ill-found,
undermanned, over-crowded transport, as transports
in those days were very apt to be; and
after a long, weary, and tempestuous voyage of
three months, was landed at Quebec in the beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
of the following November. Next to the
tedium of a sea voyage, nothing on earth can be
so tiresome as a description of it; the very incidents
which a Journal of such a pilgrimage commemorates
shew the dreadful state of vacuum
and ennui which must have existed in the mind of
the patient before such trifles could become of
interest sufficient to be thought worthy of notation.
A sail in sight,&mdash;a bunch of sea-weed
floating past the ship,&mdash;a log of wood covered
with barnacles,&mdash;or, better still, one of the numerous
tribe of Medusa, with its snake-like feelers
and changeable colours&mdash;a gull, or a flock of
Mother Carey&#39;s chickens, paddling in the wake,&mdash;are
occurrences of sufficient importance to call
upon deck all the passengers, even during dinner.
Or if they are happy enough to fall in with a
shoal of porpoises or dolphins, a flock of flying
fish, or a whale blowing and spouting near the
ship, such a wonder is quite sufficient to furnish
conversation for the happy beholders for the rest
of the voyage. For my own part, being familiar
with, and also seasoned to, all the wonders of
the deep, I make a vow whenever I go on board,
that nothing inferior in rank and dignity to a
sea-serpent shall ever induce me to mount the
companion ladder. On the whole, though it cannot
be considered as a very choice bit of reading,
I look upon the log-book as by far the best account
of a voyage, for it accurately states all
that is worthy of note in the fewest possible
words. It is the very model of the terse didactic.
Who can fail to admire the Caesar-like brevity in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
an American captain&#39;s log: "At noon, light
breezes and cloudy weather, wind W.S.W., fell in
with a phenomenon&mdash;caught a bucket full of it."
Under all these circumstances, I think it is highly
probable that my readers will readily pardon
me for not giving my <i>experience</i> on this subject.
I met with no seas "mountains high," as many
who have gone down unto the sea in ships have
done. Indeed, though I have encountered gales
of wind in all the favorite playgrounds of Oeolus&mdash;the
Bay of Biscay&mdash;off the Cape of Good Hope&mdash;in
the Bay of Bengal&mdash;the coast of America,
and the Gulph of St. Lawrence, yet I never saw
a wave high enough to becalm the main-top sail.
So that I must suppose that the original inventor
of the phrase was a Cockney, who must have
had Garlic hill or Snow hill, or some of the
other mountainous regions of the metropolis in
his mind&#39;s eye when he coined it.</p>

<p class="indent">Arrived at Quebec, we reported ourselves, as in
duty bound, to the General Commanding, and by
his orders we left a subaltern to command the
recruits (most of whom, by the way, were mere
boys,) and to strengthen the Garrison of Quebec,
and the venerable old colonel and myself made
all haste to join our regiment up the country. As
my worthy old commander was a character,
some account of him may not be uninteresting.</p>

<p class="indent">Donald McB&mdash;&mdash; was born in the celebrated winter
of 1745-46, while his father, an Invernesshire
gentleman, was <i>out</i> with Prince Charles Edward,
who, on the unfortunate issue of that campaign
for the Jacobite interest, was fain to flee to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
France, where he joined his royal master, and
where, by the Prince&#39;s influence, he received a
commission in the Scotch Regiment of Guards,
and in due time retired with a small pension
from the French King, to the town of Dunkirk,
where with his family, he remained the rest of
his days.</p>

<p class="indent">Donald, meanwhile, was left with his kindred in
the Highlands, where he grew in all the stinted
quantity of grace that is to be found in that barren
region, until his seventh year, when he was
sent to join his family in Dunkirk. Here he was
educated, and as his father&#39;s military experience
had given him no great love for the profession of
arms, he was in due time bound apprentice to his
brother-in-law, an eminent surgeon of that town,
and might have become a curer instead of inflicter
of broken heads, or at least murdered men
more scientifically than with the broadsword;
but fate ordered it otherwise.</p>

<p class="indent">Donald had an objection as strong to the lancet
as his father could possibly have to the sword.
Had the matter been coolly canvassed, it is hard
to say which mode of murder would have obtained
the preference, but, always hasty, he did not
go philosophically to work, and an accident decided
his fate as it has done that of many greater
men.</p>

<p class="indent">A young nun of great beauty, who had lately
taken the veil, had the misfortune to break her
leg, and Donald&#39;s master, being medical man to
the convent, he very reasonably hoped that he
would assist in the setting of it&mdash;attending upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
handsome young nuns might reconcile a man even
to being a surgeon of&mdash;&mdash;; but his brother-in-law
and the abbess both entered their veto. Piqued
at this disappointment, next morning saw him
on the tramp, and the next intelligence that was
heard of him was that he was serving His Most
Christian Majesty in the capacity of a Gentleman
Sentinel, (as the Baron of Bradwardine hath it,)
in a marching regiment.</p>

<p class="indent">This settled the point. His father, seeing that
his aversion to the healing art was insuperable,
procured a commission in the Regiment de Dillon
or Irish Brigade of the French Service.</p>

<p class="indent">In this he served for several years, until he had
got pretty well up among the lieutenants, and in
due time might have figured among the marshals
of Napoleon; but the American Revolution breaking
out, and it being pretty apparent that France
and Great Britain must come into hostile collision,
his father, though utterly abhorring the
reigning dynasty, could not bear the idea of a
son of his fighting against his country and clan,
persuaded him to resign his commission in the
French Service, and sent him to Scotland with
letters of recommendation to some of his kindred
and friends, officers in the newly raised
Frazer Highlanders (since the 71st,) whom he
joined in Greenock in the year 1776, and soon
after embarked with them for America in the
capacity of a gentleman volunteer, thus beginning
the world once more at the age of thirty.</p>

<p class="indent">After serving in this regiment till he obtained
his ensigncy, he was promoted to be lieutenant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
and adjutant in the Cavalry of Tarlton&#39;s Legion,
in which he served and was several times wounded,
till the end of the war, when he was disbanded
with the rest of his regiment, and placed on
half pay. He exchanged into a regiment about
to embark for the West Indies, where in seven or
eight years, the yellow fever standing his friend
by cutting off many of his brother officers, while
it passed over him, he in progress of seniority,
tontined it up to nearly the head of the lieutenants;
the regiment was ordered home in 1790,
and after a short time, instead of his company,
he received his half-pay as a disbanded lieutenant.</p>

<p class="indent">He now, from motives of economy as well as
to be near his surviving relatives, retired to Dunkirk;
but the approaching revolution soon called
him out again, and his promotion, which,
though like that of Dugald Dalgetty, it was
"dooms slow at first," did come at last. Now
after thirty-seven years&#39; hard service in the British
Army, (to say nothing of fourteen in the
French) in North America, the West Indies,
South America, the Cape of Good Hope, Java
and India, he found himself a Lieutenant-Colonel
of a second battalion serving in Canada. Such is
a brief memoir of my old commanding officer.
He was a warm-hearted, hot-tempered, jovial,
gentlemanly old veteran, who enjoyed the present
and never repined at the past; so it may
well be imagined that I was in high good luck
with such a <i>compagnon de voyage</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Hearing that the American Army, under General
Wilkinson, was about to make descent on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
Canada somewhere about the lower end of Lake
Ontario, we were determined to push on with all
possible speed.</p>

<p class="indent">The roads, however, were declared impracticable,
and the only steamboat the Canadas then
rejoiced in, though now they must possess nearly
one hundred, had sailed that day, and was not
expected to return for nearly a week; so it was
determined we should try our luck in one of the
wretched river craft which in those days enjoyed
the carrying trade between Quebec and Montreal.
Into the small cabin, therefore of one of these
schooners we stowed ourselves. Though the
winds were light, we managed to make some way
as long as we could take advantage of the flood-tide,
and lay by during the ebb; but after this
our progress was slow indeed; not entirely from
the want of a fair wind, but from the cursed dilatory
habits of Frenchmen and their Canadian
descendants in all matters connected with business.
At every village (and in Lower Canada
there is a village at every three leagues along the
banks of the St. Lawrence) our captain had or
made business&mdash;a cask of wine had to be delivered
to "<i>le digne Curé</i>" at one place; a box of
goods to "<i>M. le Gentilhomme de Magasin</i>" at
another; the captain&#39;s "<i>parents</i>" lived within a
league, and he had not seen them for six weeks,&mdash;so
off he must go, and no prospect of seeing
him any more for that day. The cottage of the
cabin boy&#39;s mother unluckily lay on the bank of
the river, and we must lay to till madame came
off with confitures, cabbages and clean shirts for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
his regalement; then the embracing, and kissing,
and bowing, and taking off red night caps to
each other, and the telling the news and hearing
it, occupied ten times the space that the real
business (if any there was) could possibly require.
And all this was gone through on their part, as
if it was the natural and necessary consequence
of a voyage up the River Saint Lawrence. Haste
seemed to them quite out of the question; and it
is next to impossible to get into a passion and
swear at a Frenchman, as you would at a sulky
John Bull, or a saucy Yankee, under similar circumstances,
for he is utterly unconscious all the
time that he is doing anything unworthy; he is
so polite, complaisant and good humoured withal,
that it is next to impossible to get yourself seriously
angry with him. On the fifth day of this
tedious voyage, when we had arrived within
about fifteen miles of Three Rivers, which is midway
between the two cities, we perceived the
steamboat passing upwards close under the opposite
shore, and we resolved to land, knowing
that it was her custom to stop there all night,
and proceed in the morning; accordingly we did
so, and in a short time were seated in a caleche
following at all the speed the roads would admit
of&mdash;by dint of hard travelling, bribing and coaxing,
we managed to get to Three Rivers by
moonlight, about one in the morning. So far so
good, thought we; but unluckily the moonlight
that served us, served the steamboat also, and
she had proceeded on her voyage before we came
up. As we now, however, had got quite enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
of sailing, we determined to proceed by land to
Montreal.</p>

<p class="indent">The French, I suspect, have always been before
us in Colonial policy. An arbitrary government
can do things which a free one may not have the
nerve to attempt, particularly among a people
whose ignorance permits them to see only one
side of the question.</p>

<p class="indent">The system of land travelling in Lower Canada
was better, when we became master of it, than
it is now in any part of the North American
Continent. At every three leagues there was a
"<i>Maison de Poste</i>" kept by a functionary who received
his license from government, and denominated
a "<i>Maitre de Poste</i>." He was bound by his
engagement to find caleches and horses for all
travellers, and he made engagements with his
neighbors to furnish them when his were employed.
These were called "<i>Aides de Poste</i>"; and
they received the pay when they performed the
duty, deducting a small commission for the
<i>Maitre</i>. They were bound to travel when the
roads admitted of it, at a rate not less than
seven miles an hour, and were not to exceed
quarter of an hour in changing horses; and to
prevent imposition, in the parlour of each post
house, (which was also an inn,) was stuck up a
printed paper, giving the distance of each post
from the next, and the sum to be charged for
each horse and caleche employed, as well as other
regulations, with regard to the establishment,
which it was necessary for a traveller to know,
and any well substantiated charge against these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
people was sure to call down summary punishment.</p>

<p class="indent">The roads not being, as already remarked, in
the best order, we did not arrive at Montreal
till the end of the second day, when we were
congratulated by our more lucky companions
who had left Quebec in the steamboat three days
later, and arrived at Montreal two days before
us; and we were tantalized by a description of
all the luxuries of that then little known conveyance,
as contrasted with the fatigues and <i>désagréments</i>
of our mode of progression. For the
last fifty miles of our route there was not to be
seen throughout the country a single man fit to
carry arms occupied about his farm or workshop;
women, children, or men disabled by age or decrepitude
were all that were to be met with.</p>

<p class="indent">The news had arrived that the long threatened
invasion had at last taken place, and every available
man was hurrying to meet it. We came up
with several regiments of militia on their line of
march. They had all a serviceable effective appearance&mdash;had
been pretty well drilled, and their
arms being direct from the tower, were in perfectly
good order, nor had they the mobbish appearance
that such a levy in any other country
would have had. Their capots and trowsers of
home-spun stuff, and their blue <i>tuques</i> (night
caps) were all of the same cut and color, which
gave them an air of uniformity that added much
to their military look, for I have always remarked
that a body of men&#39;s appearance in battalion,
depends much less on the fashion of their individual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
dress and appointments, than on the
whole being in strict uniformity.</p>

<p class="indent">They marched merrily along to the music of
their voyageur songs, and as they perceived our
uniform as we came up, they set up the Indian
War-whoop, followed by a shout of <i>Vive le Roi</i>
along the whole line. Such a body of men in
such a temper, and with so perfect a use of their
arms as all of them possessed, if posted on such
ground as would preclude the possibility of regular
troops out-manoeuvering them, (and such positions
are not hard to find in Canada,) must have
been rather a formidable body to have attacked.
Finding that the enemy were between us and our
regiment, proceeding to join would have been out
of the question. The Colonel therefore requested
that we might be attached to the militia on the
advance. The Commander-in-Chief finding that
the old gentleman had a perfect knowledge of the
French language, (not by any means so common
an accomplishment in the army in those days as
it is now,) gave him command of a large brigade
of militia, and, like other men who rise to greatness,
his friends and followers shared his good
fortune, for a subaltern of our regiment who had
come out in another ship and joined us at Montreal,
was appointed as his Brigade Major; and I
was exalted to the dignity of Principal Medical
Officer to his command, and we proceeded to Lachine,
the head-quarters of the advance, and
where it had been determined to make the stand,
in order to cover Montreal, the great commercial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
emporium of the Canadas, and which, moreover,
was the avowed object of the American attack.</p>

<p class="indent">Our force here presented rather a motley appearance;
besides a small number of the line
consisting chiefly of detachments, there was a
considerable body of sailors and marines; the
former made tolerable Artillery men, and the
latter had, I would say, even a more serviceable
appearance than an equal body of the line, average
it throughout the army.</p>

<p class="indent">The fact is that during the war the marines
had the best recruits that entered the army. The
reason of this, as explained to me by an intelligent
non-commissioned officer of that corps,
was, that whereas a soldier of the line, returning
on furlough to his native village, had barely
enough of money to pay his travelling expenses,
and support him while there, and even that with
a strict attention to economy, the marine, on the
other hand, on returning from a three years&#39;
cruise, had all the surplus pay and prize money
of that period placed in his hands before he started,
and this, with his pay going on at the same
rate as that of the soldier of the line, enabled
him to expend in a much more gentlemanly style
of profusion than the other.</p>

<p class="indent">The vulgar of all ranks are apt to form their
opinions of things rather from their results than
the causes of them, and hence they jump to the
conclusion that the marine service must be just
so much better than that of the line, as the one
has so much more money to spend on his return
home than the other. And hence, aspiring&mdash;or as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
our quarter master, Tom Sheridan, used to say
when recruiting sergeant, <i>perspiring</i>&mdash;young heroes,
who resolve to gain a field marshal&#39;s baton
by commencing with a musket, preferred the amphibious
path of the jolly to the exclusively terraqueous
one of the flat-foot. Besides these and our
friends the country militia, there were two corps
formed of the gentlemen of Montreal, one of artillery
and another of sharp-shooters. I think these
were in a perfect state of drill, and in their handsome
new uniforms had a most imposing appearance.
But if their discipline was commendable,
their commissariat was beyond all praise. Long
lines of carts were to be seen bearing in casks
and hampers of the choicest wines, to say nothing
of the venison, turkeys, hams, and all other
esculents necessary to recruit their strength under
the fatigues of war. With them the Indian found
a profitable market for his game, and the fisherman
for his fish. There can be little doubt that
a gourmand would greatly prefer the comfort of
dining with a mess of privates of these distinguished
corps to the honour and glory of being
half starved (of which he ran no small risk) at
the table of the Governor General himself. Such
a force opposed to an equal number of regulars,
it may be said, was no very hopeful prospect for
defending a country. But there are many things
which, when taken into consideration, will show
that the balance was not so very much against
them as at first sight may appear. Men who are
fighting for their homes and friends, and almost
in sight of their wives and children, have an additional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
incentive over those who fight for pay
and glory. Again, the enemy to attack them
had to land from a rapid, a thing which precludes
regularity under any circumstances, and they
would not be rendered more cool by a heavy fire
of artillery while they were yawning and whirling
in the current. They must have landed in
confusion, and would be attacked before they
could form, and should they get over all this, there
was a plateau of land in the rear ascended by a
high steep bank, which, in tolerable hands, could
neither be carried nor turned. Add to all this,
that the American regulars, if equal, were not
superior to our troops in drill and discipline, the
great majority of them having been enlisted for
a period too short to form a soldier, under the
most favorable circumstances. And much even
of that short time had been consumed in
long and harassing marches through an unsettled
country that could not supply the commissariat,
and exposed to fatigue and privation that was
rapidly spreading disease among them; dispirited
too by recent defeat, with a constantly increasing
force hanging on their rear. If they even had
forced us at Lachine, they must have done it at
an enormous loss. In their advance also towards
Montreal, they must have fought every inch of
the way, harrassed in front, flank and in rear,
and their army so diminished that they could not
hold Montreal if they had it. On the whole,
therefore,&mdash;any reflections on the conduct of General
Wilkinson by those great military critics, the
editors of American newspapers, to the contrary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
notwithstanding,&mdash;every soldier will admit, that
in withdrawing with a comparatively unbroken
army to his intrenchment on Salmon River, the
American commander did the very wisest thing
that under all the circumstances he could have
done. What the event of a battle might have
been it is now impossible to say, for on this
ground it was fated we were to show our devotion
to our king and country at a cheaper rate,
for the news of the battle of Chrysler&#39;s Farm,
and the subsequent retreat of the Americans
across the river, blighted all our hopes of laurels
for this turn.</p>

<p class="indent">This was a very brilliant little affair. Colonel
Morrison of the 89th Regiment, was sent by
General de Rotenburg, with a small corp amounting
in all to 820 men, Regulars, Militia and Indians,
to watch the motions of the American
army, when it broke up from Grenadier Island,
near Kingston, and to hang on and harass their
rear. This was done so effectually that General
Covington was detached with a body at least
three times our number to drive them back.
Morrison retired till he came to a spot he had
selected on his downward march, and there gave
them battle. Luckily for us, the first volley we
fired killed General Covington, who must have
been a brave fine fellow; the officer succeeding
him brought his undisciplined levies too near
our well-drilled troops before he deployed, and
in attempting to do so, got thrown into confusion,
thus giving our artillery and gun-boats an
opportunity of committing dreadful slaughter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
among their confused and huddled masses. They
rallied, however, again, but were driven off by
the bayonet; but all this cost us dear, for we
were too much weakened to follow up our victory.
They retired therefore in comparative
safety to about seven miles above the village of
Cornwall, where they crossed the river without
loss, save from a body of Highland militia, from
Glengarry, who made a sudden attack on their
cavalry while embarking, and by firing into the
boats by which they were swimming over their
horses, made them let go their bridles, and the
animals swimming to the shore, were seized upon
by Donald, who thus came into action a foot
soldier, and went out of it a dragoon, no doubt,
like his countryman, sorely "<i>taight wi&#39; ta peast</i>"
on his journey home.<a name="FNanchor_A_A" id="FNanchor_A_A"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_A_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> The enemy then took up
a position and fortified a camp, where they remained
during the winter, and when preparations
were made to drive them out of it in the spring,
they suddenly abandoned their position, leaving
behind them their stores and baggage, and retreated,
followed by our forces, as far as the village
of Malone, in the State of New York. Thus
ended the "<i>partumeius mons</i>" of the only efficient
invasion of Canada during the war. The
fact is, the Americans were deceived in all their
schemes of conquest in Canada; the disaffected
then as now were the loudest in their clamour,
and a belief obtained among the Americans that
they had only to display their colours to have the
whole population flock to them. But the reverse
of this was the case. They found themselves in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
a country so decidedly hostile, that their retreating
ranks were thinned by the peasantry firing
on them from behind fences and stumps; and
it was evident that every man they met was an
enemy. The militia at Lachine, after being duly
thanked for their services, were sent home, and
the regulars went into winter quarters; the sailors
and marines to Kingston&mdash;and we, having
enjoyed our newly acquired dignities for a few
days, set off to join our regiment then quartered
at Fort Wellington, a clumsy, ill-constructed unflanked
redoubt, close to which now stands the
large and populous village of Prescott, then consisting
of five houses, three of which were unfinished.
The journey was a most wretched one.
The month of November being far advanced, rain
and sleet poured down in torrents&mdash;the roads at
no season good, were now barely fordable, so
that we found it the easiest way to let our
waggon go on with our baggage, and walk
through the fields, and that too, though at every
two hundred yards, or oftener, we had to scramble
over a rail fence, six feet high; sometimes we
got a lift in a boat, sometimes we were dragged
by main force in a waggon through the deep
mud, in which it was hard to say whether the
peril of upsetting or drowning was the most imminent.
Sometimes we marched; but all that
could be said of any mode of travel was, that it
was but a variety of the disagreeable; so, as
there was no glory to be gained in such a service,
I was anything but sorry when I learned that I
was to halt for some time at a snug, comfortable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
warm, cleanly, Dutch farm house, to take
charge of the wounded who had suffered in the
action of Chrysler&#39;s Farm.</p>

The Highlander is no equestrian&mdash;he can trot on his feet
fifty or sixty miles a day, with much greater ease to himself, and in
a shorter space of time, than he could ride the same distance. A
gentleman once sent his Highland servant a message on urgent
business, and to enable him to execute it sooner, gave him a horse.
Donald did not return at the time expected, nor for long after it;
at last his master, who was watching anxiously for him, discerned
him at a long distance on the road on foot, creeping at a snail&#39;s
pace, and <i>towing</i> the reluctant quadruped by the bridle. On being
objurgated for his tardiness, he replied "he could have been here
twa three hours, but he has taight wi&#39; ta peast," <i>i.e.</i> delayed, or
impeded by the horse.</p>

<p class="indent">Washington Irving is the only describer of your
"American Teutonic Race," and this, my debut
in the New World, put me down in the midst of
that worthy people as unsophisticated as possible.
It is <i>refreshing</i>, as his little Lordship of
Craigcrook used to say, in this land where every
man is a philosopher, and talks of government
as if he had been bred at the feet of Machiavel,
to meet with a specimen of genuine simplicity,
perfectly aware of his own ignorance in matters
which in no way concern him. Your Dutchman
is the most unchangeable of all human beings,
"<i>Caelum non animum mutant, qui trans mare
currunt</i>" applies with peculiar force to the Batavian
in every clime on the face of the globe.
In America, at the Cape of Good Hope, in the
congenial marshes of Java, in the West Indies,
and at Chinsurhae on the banks of the Ganges,
the transmarine Hollander is always the same
as in his own native mud of the dams and dykes
of Holland,&mdash;the same in his house, his dress, his
voracious and omniverous appetite, his thrift and
his cleanliness.</p>

<p class="indent">Among these good, kind, simple people, I spent
a month or six weeks very pleasantly. Loyal
and warmly attached to the British Crown, they
followed our standard in the Revolutionary War,
and obtained from government settlements in
Canada when driven from their homes on the
banks of the Hudson. From what I could learn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
from them, the Americans had persecuted them
and their families with a rancour they displayed
to no other race of mankind. When prisoners
were taken in action, while the British were
treated by them with respect, and even with
kindness, the Dutch were deliberately murdered in
cold blood. Men without arms in their hands,
but suspected of favouring the British cause, were
shot before their own doors, or hanged on the
apple trees of their own orchards, in presence of
their wives and families, who without regard to
age or sex, were turned from their homes without
remorse or pity. And one old dame told me
that she was for six weeks in the woods between
Utica and Niagara, unaccompanied by any one
but her two infant children, looking for her husband,
who she luckily found in the fort of the
latter place; at one time she and her poor babes
must have perished from hunger, but for some
Mohawk Indians, who came up and delivered
them, and conducted them to the Fort. The
Dutch themselves ascribe this very different
treatment of the two races to the fear of the
Americans that the British would retaliate in
case they were ill used, while the Dutch could
not.</p>

<p class="indent">This, however, could not have been the case,
for had the Americans feared vengeance on the
part of the British for the wrongs they inflicted
on their countrymen, they must have equally
feared that they would not quietly submit to
injuries inflicted on men who were their loyal and
faithful fellow subjects. I therefore suspect, that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
so far as their statements were correct, and they
must have been so in the main, for I have the
same stories from the Dutch of the Niagara District,
who had no communication whatever with
their compatriots of Williamsburg, and though
we must allow great latitude for exaggeration in
a people who were, no doubt, deeply injured, and
had been brooding over their wrongs for a period
of upwards of thirty years, during all which
time their wrath had gathered force as it went,
and their stories having no one to contradict
them, must have increased with each subsequent
narrator, till they had obtained all the credence
of time-honoured truth&mdash;allowing for all this, but
insisting that the stories had a strong foundation
in fact, the rigor of their persecution must
be attributed to another feeling, and must have,
I should think, arisen from this, that the Americans
considered that a British subject born within
the realm, and fighting for what he believed to
be the rights of his country, was only doing
what they themselves were doing; whereas, a
North American born, whatever his extraction,
fighting against what they considered the rights
of the people of North America, was a traitor
and an apostate, an enemy to the cause of freedom
from innate depravity, and therefore, like a
noxious animal, was lawfully to be destroyed,
"<i>per fas et nefas</i>."  However this may be, I
found their hatred to the Americans was deep
rooted and hearty, and their kindness to us and
to our wounded, (for I never trusted them near
the American wounded,) in proportion strong and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
unceasing; my only difficulty with them was to
prevent them cramming my patients with all
manner of Dutch dainties, for their ideas of practice
being Batavian, they affirmed that there was
infinitely greater danger from inanition than repletion,
and that strength must come from nourishment.
"Unless you give de wounded man
plenty to eat and drink it is quite certain he
can never get through."</p>

<p class="indent">Killing with kindness is the commonest cause
of death I am aware of, and it is very remiss in
the faculty, that it has never yet found a place
in the periodical mortuary reports which they
publish in great cities in a tabular form&mdash;this
ought to be amended. <i>Au reste</i>&mdash;I was very
comfortable, for, while I remained under the hospitable
roof of my friend old Cobus, I had an upper
room for my sleeping apartment, and the show
room of the establishment for my sitting parlor,
an honour and preferment which nobody of less
rank them an actual line officer of the "<i>riglars</i>"
could have presumed to aspire to; to the rest of
mankind it was shut and sealed, saving on high
days and holidays. This sacred chamber was
furnished and decorated in the purest and most
classical style of Dutch taste, the whole woodwork,
and that included floor, walls and ceiling,
were sedulously washed once a week with hot
water and soap, vigorously applied with a scrubbing
brush. The floor was nicely sanded, and
the walls decorated with a tapestry of innumerable
home-spun petticoats, evidently never applied
to any other (I won&#39;t say meaner) purpose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
declaring at once the wealth and housewifery of
the gude vrow. On the shelf that ran round the
whole room, were exhibited the holiday crockery
of the establishment, bright and shining, interspersed
with pewter spoons, which were easily
mistaken for silver from the excessive brightness
of their polish. And to conclude the description
of my comforts, I had for breakfast and dinner a
variety and profusion of meat, fish, eggs, cakes
and preserves, that might have satisfied the grenadier
company of the Regiment.</p>

<p class="indent">On the Saturday morning (for this was the
grand cleansing day) I never went forth to visit
my hospital without taking my fowling piece in
my hand, and made a point of never returning
until sunset, as during the intervening period no
animal not amphibious could possibly have existed
in the domicile; after leaving them I never
passed their door on the line of march without
passing an hour or two with my old friends, and
on such occasions I used to be honoured with the
chaste salute of the worthy old dame, which was
followed by my going through the same ceremony,
to a strapping beauty, her niece, who was
"comely to be seen," and in stature rather exceeded
myself, though I stand six feet in my
stocking soles. An irreverent Irish subaltern of
ours impiously likened the decorous and fraternal
salute with which I greeted her, to the "slap of a
wet brogue against a barn door;" and the angel
who in her innocence bestowed that civility on
me, was known by my brother officers, who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
no platonism in their souls, as "The Doctor&#39;s
Sylph."</p>

<p class="indent">From the end of the first few weeks that I remained
here my patients gradually began to
diminish,&mdash;some died, and these I buried,&mdash;some
recovered by the remedies employed, or spite of
them, and these I forwarded or carried with me
to join the Regiment,&mdash;and others who from loss
of limbs or of the use of them, might be considered
as permanently rendered "<i>hors de combat</i>,"
I sent by easy stages to Montreal General Hospital,
thence in the spring to be removed to England
as occasion offered, thence to enjoy the honours
and emoluments of a Chelsea Pension. The
few that remained unfit to be removed I committed
to the charge of an Hospital Mate, and proceeded
with all convenient speed to join the headquarters
of my Regiment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

</div>

<p class="indent">I joined my regiment at Fort Wellington, and
a fine jovial unsophisticated set of "wild tremendous
Irishmen" I found my brother officers to be.
To do them justice (and I was upwards of four
years with them) a more honest-hearted set of
fellows never met round a mess table. No private
family ever lived in more concord or unanimity
than did "Our Mess."</p>

<p class="indent">Irishmen though they mostly were, they never
quarrelled among themselves. They sometimes
fought, to be sure, with strangers, but never in
the Regiment, though we rarely went to bed
without a respectable quorum of them getting a
<i>leetle</i> to the lee side of sobriety.</p>

<p class="indent">"Tempora mutantur," says Horace, but I very
much doubt if "nos" (that is such as are alive of
&#39;nos&#39;) "mutamur in illis." The Army is very
different from what it was in my day&mdash;sadly
changed indeed! It will hardly be believed, but
I have dined with officers who, after drinking a
few glasses of wine, called for their coffee. If
Waterloo was to fight over again, no rational
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
man can suppose that we would gain it after
such symptoms of degeneracy. Such lady-like
gentlemen would certainly take out vinaigrettes
and scream at a charge of the Old Guard, and be
horrified at the sight of a set of grim-looking
Frenchmen, all grin and gash, whisker and moustache.</p>

<p class="indent">I was not, however, allowed to enjoy the festivities
of Fort Wellington, such as they were.
The enemy being extended along the line of the
right bank of the St. Lawrence, and the Lake of
the Thousand Islands, it was necessary that we
also should extend and occupy points that might
enable us to keep up a communication, and maintain
a correspondence with our rear. Besides it
was considered highly expedient and necessary,
that small bodies of the line should be stationed
in defensible positions, to form a nucleus, in case
of invasion, for the Indians and Militia to rally
round and form upon. Accordingly, a garrison
had to be maintained in a block-house in the
woods of Gananoque, between Brockville and
Kingston, and our Grenadier Company being ordered
for that service, I was detached to accompany
them. A block-house is a most convenient
and easily constructed fort in a new country.
The lower story is strongly built of stone, and
the upper, which overhangs it about eighteen
inches, (so that you can fire from above along
the wall without being exposed,) is built of logs
about a foot square. Both stories are pierced
with loop-holes for musquetry, and in the upper
are four portholes, to which are fitted four 24-pounder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
carronades, mounted naval fashion, the
whole being surrounded with a strong loop-holed
and flanked stoccade, and this makes a very fair
protection for an inferior force, against a superior
who are unprovided with a battering train,
which of course in a few rounds would knock it
to splinters.</p>

<p class="indent">Except in the expectation of a sudden attack,
the officers were permitted to sleep out of the
block-house, and a small unfinished house was
taken for their residence. The captain and senior
lieutenant being, as Bardolph hath it, better <i>accommodated</i>
than with wives, we, that is the
junior lieutenant and myself, gave up our share
of the quarters to them, and established ourselves
in what had been a blacksmith&#39;s shop, for
our winter quarters. In the ante-room to this
enviable abode, a jobbing tailor had formed his
shop-board, and his rags and shapings proved
highly useful in caulking its seams against the
wind. By means of a roaring fire kept up on the
forge, and a stove in the outer room, we managed
to keep ourselves tolerably comfortable
during an unusually rigorous winter; and it being
on the road side, and a halting station in
the woods, we were often visited by friends coming
or going, who partook with great goût of our
frozen beef&mdash;which had to be cut into steaks with
a hand-saw. Being on the banks of a fine stream,
we never were at loss for ducks, and in the surrounding
pine woods the partridges were abundant,
and the Indians brought us venison in exchange
for rum, so that we had at least a plentiful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
if not an elegant table, and we were enabled
to pass the winter nights as pleasantly over our
ration rum as ever I did in a place with much
more splendid "appliances and means to boot."</p>

<p class="indent">We passed the remainder of the winter as officers
are obliged to do in country quarters. We
shot, we lounged, we walked and did all the flirtation
that the neighborhood of a mill, a shop, a
tavern, with two farm houses within a reasonable
forenoon&#39;s walk, could afford. We were deprived,
however, of the luxury of spitting over a
bridge, which Dr. Johnston says is the principal
amusement of officers in country quarters, for
though we had a bridge close at hand, the stream
beneath it was frozen. Early in spring we were
relieved by two companies of another Regiment,
and having received orders to join, we joined accordingly.</p>

<p class="indent">I had the good fortune to be quartered with
two companies of my Regiment at the then insignificant
village of Cornwall. It is now a flourishing
town, and sends a Member to the Provincial
Parliament, though it then did not contain
more than twenty houses. Here we found ourselves
in very agreeable society, composed principally
of old officers of the revolutionary war,
who had obtained grants of land in this neighbourhood,
and had <i>settled down</i>, as we say in this
part of the country and its neighbourhood, with
their families. An affectation of style, and set
entertainments that follow so rapidly the footsteps
of wealth, were then and there unknown,
and we immediately became on the best possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
terms with the <i>highest circles</i> (for these exist in
all societies, and the smaller the society, the
more distinctly is the circle defined). We walked
into their houses as if they had been our own,
and no apology was offered, though these were
found in such a litter as washing or scrubbing
day necessarily implied. The old gentlemen when
in town came to Our Mess, and when they had
imbibed a sufficient quantity of port, they regaled
us with toughish yarns of their military doings
during the revolutionary war. And when a tea-drinking
party called a sufficient number of the
aristocracy together, an extemporaneous dance
was got up, a muffled drum and fife furnishing
the orchestra.</p>

<p class="indent">Towards the end of June our two companies
got the route to join headquarters, the Regiment
being ordered to the Niagara frontier. But
though the troops were relieved, I was not, but
ordered to remain till some one should arrive to
fill my place, and in the interval between that
and my departure a Field Officer, who was sent
to command the Militia of the district, arrived.</p>

<p class="indent">He was an old acquaintance of mine, and a real
good fellow. He had highly distinguished himself
during the war, particularly at the storming of
Ogdensburg, where he commanded. He was of
Highland extraction, and though he had not the
misfortune to be born in that country, he had,
by means of the instructions of a Celtic moonshee,
(as they say in Bengal,) acquired enough of
their language to hammer out a translation of a
verse or two of the Gaelic Bible, with nearly as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
much facility as a boy in the first year of the
Grammar School would an equal quantity of his
Cordery. To all these good gifts he added the
advantage of being of the Catholic persuasion,
which rendered him the most proper person that
could have been selected to take charge of a district
the chief part of whose Militia were Highlanders,
Catholics, and soldiers, or the sons of
soldiers.</p>

<p class="indent">I have never met with him since the end of the
war, though I might have seen him in Edinburgh
at the King&#39;s visit; but who could be expected
to recognize a respectable Field Officer of Light
Infantry, masquerading, disguised for the first
time in his life in a kilt, and forming a joint in
the tail of the chief of his barbarous clan?</p>

<p class="indent">It struck this gentleman that supplies of fresh
provisions might be got from the American side,
and accordingly he sent emissaries over the river,
and the result justified the correctness of his
views.</p>

<p class="indent">While sitting after dinner one day <i>tete-à-tete</i>
with the Colonel, his servant announced that a
gentleman wanted to see him. As the word <i>gentleman</i>
on this side of the Atlantic conveys no
idea of either high birth or high breeding, nor
even of a clean shirt, or a whole coat, my friend
demanded what kind of a gentleman,&mdash;as, like a
sensible man as he was, he did not wish to be
interrupted in the pleasant occupation of discussing
his wine and listening to my agreeable
conversation, by a gentleman who possibly might
ask him if he wished to buy any eggs, as many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
species of the <i>genus</i> gentleman on this side of the
herring pond might possibly deem a good and
sufficient reason for intruding on his privacy.
His servant said he believed he must be a kind
of Yankee gentleman, for he wore his hat in the
parlor, and spit on the carpet. The <i>causa scientiae</i>,
as the lawyers say, seemed conclusive to
my Commandant, for he was ordered to be admitted,
and the Colonel, telling me that he suspected
this must be one of his beef customers, requested
I would not leave the room, as he wished
a witness to the bargain he was about to
make.</p>

<p class="indent">Accordingly, there entered a tall, good-looking,
middle-aged man, dressed in a blue something,
that might have been a cross between a surtout
and a great coat. He was invited to sit down,
and fill his glass, when the following dialogue
took place:</p>

<p class="indent">Yankee.&mdash;I&#39;m Major &mdash;&mdash; of Vermont State,
and I would like to speak to the Colonel in private,
I guess, on particular business.</p>

<p class="indent">Colonel.&mdash;Anything you may have to say to
me, Sir, may be said with perfect safety in presence
of this gentleman.</p>

<p class="indent">Major.&mdash;I&#39;m a little in the smuggling line, I
reckon.</p>

<p class="indent">Colonel.&mdash;Aye, and pray what have you smuggled?</p>

<p class="indent">Major.&mdash;Kettle, (cattle,) I reckon. I heerd that
the Colonel wanted some very bad, so I just
brought a hundred on &#39;em across at St. Regis, as
fine critters, Colonel, as ever had hair on &#39;em.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
So I drove them right up; the Colonel can look
at &#39;em hisself&mdash;they are right at the door here.</p>

<p class="indent">Colonel.&mdash;Well, what price do you ask for
them?</p>

<p class="indent">Major.&mdash;Well, Colonel I expect about the same
as other folks gets, I conclude.</p>

<p class="indent">Colonel.&mdash;That is but reasonable, and you shall
have it.</p>

<p class="indent">The Commissary of the Post was sent for, and
having been previously warned not to be very
scrupulous in inspecting the drove, as it was of
infinitely more importance to get the army supplied
than to obtain them at the very lowest rate
per head, he soon returned with a bag of half
eagles, and paid the Major the sum demanded.
The latter, after carefully counting the coin, returned
it into the canvas bag, and opening his
coat displayed inside the breast of it, a pocket
about the size of a haversack, into which he
dropped his treasure, and then deliberately buttoning
it up from the bottom to the throat, he
filled and drank a glass of wine, to our good
healths; adding, "Well, Colonel, I must say you
are a leetle the genteelest man to deal with ever
I met with, and I&#39;ll tell all my friends how handsome
you behaved to me; and I&#39;m glad of it for
their sakes as well as my own, for jist as I was
fixing to start from St. Regis, my friend Colonel
&mdash;&mdash; arrived with three hundred head more.
The kettle arnt his&#39;n; they belong to his father,
who is our Senator. They do say that it is
wrong to supply an innimy, and I think so too;
but I don&#39;t call that man my innimy who buys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
what I have to sell, and gives a genteel price for
it. We have worse innimies than you Britishers.
So I hope the Colonel will behave all the same
as well to them as he has done to me; but there
was no harm in having the first of the market,
you know, Colonel." So with a duck that was
intended for a bow, and a knowing grin that
seemed to say, "It was just as safe to secure
my money before giving you this piece of
information," he took his leave and departed, evidently
much pleased with the success of his negotiation.</p>

<p class="indent">At this time the expense of carrying on the
war was enormous. Canada, so far from being
able to supply an army and navy with the provisions
required, was (as a great many of her
effective population were employed in the transport
of military and naval stores,) not fit to
supply her own wants, and it was essential to
secure supplies from wherever they could be got
soonest and cheapest. Troops acting on the Niagara
frontier, 1,000 miles from the ocean, were
fed with flour the produce of England, and pork
and beef from Cork, which, with the waste inseparable
from a state of war, the expense and
accidents to which a long voyage expose them,
and the enormous cost of internal conveyance, at
least doubled the quantity required, and rendered
the price of them at least ten times their original
cost. Not only provisions, but every kind
of Military and Naval Stores, every bolt of canvas,
every rope yarn, as well as the heavier articles
of guns, shot, cables, anchors, and all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
numerous etceteras for furnishing a large squadron,
arming forts, supplying arms for the militia
and the line, had to be brought from Montreal
to Kingston, a distance of nearly 200 miles, by
land in winter, and in summer by flat-bottomed
boats, which had to tow up the rapids, and sail
up the still parts of the river, (in many places
not a mile in breadth, between the British and
American shores,) exposed to the shot of the
enemy without any protection; for with the
small body of troops we had in the country, it
was utterly impossible that we could detach a
force sufficient to protect the numerous <i>brigades</i>
of boats that were daily proceeding up the river,
and we must have been utterly undone, had not
the ignorance and inertness of the enemy saved
us. Had they stationed four field guns, covered
by a corps of riflemen, on the banks of the St.
Lawrence, they could have cut off our supplies
without risking one man. As it was we had only
to station a small party at every fifty miles, to
be ready to act in case of alarm; but fortunately
for us, they rarely or never troubled us. If
they had done so with any kind of spirit, we
must have abandoned Upper Canada, Kingston
and the fleet on Ontario included, and leaving it
to its fate, confined ourselves to the defence of
such part of the Lower Province as came within
the range of our own empire, the sea.</p>

<p class="indent">I would do gross injustice to my reader, no
less than to myself, were I to quit Cornwall
without mentioning a most worthy personage,
who, though in a humble station, was one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
best and most original characters I ever met
with in my progress through life. This was no
other than my worthy hostess, of the principal
log hotel, Peggy Bruce. If you could conceive
Meg Dodds an Irish instead of a Scotch woman,
you would have a lively conception of Peggy.
She possessed all the virtues of her prototype, all
her culinary talents, all her caprice with guests
she did not take a fancy for, and all powers, offensive
or defensive, by tongue or broom, as the
case in hand rendered the one or the other more
expedient.</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy was the daughter of a respectable Irish
farmer, and had made a runaway match with a
handsome young Scotch sergeant. She had accompanied
her husband through the various campaigns
of the revolutionary war, and at the
peace, his regiment being disbanded, they set up
a small public house, which, when I knew her as
a widow, she still kept. The sign was a long
board, decorated by a very formidable likeness of
St. Andrew at the one end, and St. Patrick at
the other, being the patron saints of the high
contracting parties over whose domicile they
presided, and the whole surrounded by a splendid
wreath of thistles and shamrocks.</p>

<p class="indent">Bred in the army, she still retained her old
military predeliction, and a scarlet coat was the
best recommendation to her good offices. Civilians
of whatever rank she deemed an inferior
class of the human race, and it would have been
a hard task to have convinced her that the Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
Chancellor was equal in dignity or station to a
Captain of Dragoons.</p>

<p class="indent">It was my luck, (good or bad as the reader
may be inclined to determine,) to be a prodigious
favourite with the old lady; but even favour with
the ladies has its drawbacks and inconveniences,
and one of these with me was being dragged to
the bedside of every man, woman and child who
was taken ill in or about the village. At first I
remonstrated against my being appointed physician-extraordinary
to the whole parish, with
which I was in no way connected; but Peggy
found an argument which, as it seemed perfectly
satisfactory to herself, had to content me. "What
the d&mdash;l does the king pay you for, if you are
not to attend to his subjects when they require
your assistance?"</p>

<p class="indent">I once, and only once, outwitted her. She woke
me out of a sound sleep a little after midnight,
to go and see one of her patients. Having undergone
great fatigue the day before, I felt very
unwilling to get up. At first I meditated a flat
refusal, but I could see with half a glance, that
she anticipated my objections, for I saw her eye
fix itself on a large ewer of water in the basin
stand, and I knew her too well for a moment to
suppose that she would hesitate to call in the
aid of the pure element to enforce her arguments.
So I feigned compliance, but pleaded the impossibility
of my getting up, while there was a lady
in the room. This appeared only reasonable, so
she lit my candle and withdrew to the kitchen
fire, while I was at my toilet. Her back was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
sooner turned, than I rose, double-locked and
bolted the door, and retired again to rest, leaving
her to storm in the passage, and ultimately
to knock up one of the village doctors, whose
skill she was well persuaded was immeasurably
inferior to any <i>Army</i> medical man who wore His
Majesty&#39;s uniform. But though I chuckled at my
success at the time, I had to be most wary how
I approached her, and many days elapsed before
I ventured to come within broom&#39;s length of her.
At last I appeased her wrath by promising never
"in like case to offend," and so obtained her forgiveness,
and was once more taken into favour;
but Peggy was too old a soldier to be taken in
twice, or to trust to the promise of a sleepy man
that he would get up. After this, when she required
my services, she would listen to no apology
on the score of modesty, but placing her lantern
on the table, waited patiently till I was
dressed, when tucking up her gown through her
pocketholes and taking my arm, away we paddled
through the mud in company.</p>

<p class="indent">After reaching the house of the patient, and
after the wife and daughters had been duly scolded
for their neglect in not calling her in sooner,
we entered into consultation, which like many
other medical consultations, generally ended in a
difference of opinion. To a <i>military</i> surgeon,
much sooner than to any other surgeon,
there were certain great leading principles in the
healing art, to all impugning of which Peggy was
flint and adamant and when these were mooted
I much question if she would have succumbed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
even the Director General of the Army Medical
Board himself.</p>

<p class="indent">At the head of her medical dicta was that it
was essential to "support the strength." That
was to cram the patient with every kind of food
that by entreaty or importunity he could be prevailed
upon to swallow, (a practice by the way
of more learned practitioners than Peggy.) A
hot bath with herbs infused in it was another
favourite remedy, and on this we were more at
one, for the bath would most likely do good, and
the herbs no harm. Her concluding act at the
breaking up of the consultation was generally to
dive into the recesses of a pair of pockets of the
size and shape of saddle bags, from which, among
other miscellaneous contents, would she fish up a
couple of bottles of wine which she deemed might
be useful to the patient. After we had finished
business I escorted the old lady home, where
there was always something comfortable kept
warm for supper, which when we had discussed
together, with something of a stiffish horn of hot
brandy and water, we departed to our respective
dormitories.</p>

<p class="indent">Peggy, like many of her country, possessed a
keen vein of sarcastic humor, which often made
her both feared and respected. A Colonel, as
good a man, and as brave a soldier as ever drew
a sword, but too much of a martinet to be a favourite
with the militia of whom he was Inspecting
Field Officer, received a command in a division
that was then going on actual service. Peggy,
who respected his military talents at least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
as much as she disliked his hauteur, meeting him
the day before his departure, addressed him with&mdash;"Och!
Colonel dear, and are ye going to lave
us&mdash;sure there will be many a dry eye in the
town the day you quit it." When the American
Army, under Wilkinson, were coming down the
St. Lawrence, a company of Glengarry Militia
were placed at Cornwall to watch their movements,
and act as might be most expedient.
The Captain of the band was named John McDonald,
a very good and highly respectable name,
but of no earthly use to distinguish a Glengarry
man, as there were some hundreds in that part
of the world&mdash;nor would the prefix of his military
rank much mend the matter, as there are
probably some score Captain John McDonalds.
In this emergency therefore, a soubriquet becomes
indispensable. This Captain John had in
his youth served in the revolutionary war as a
corporal, in the same brigade as Peggy&#39;s husband,
therefore they were very old friends, and to
distinguish him from the clan she named him
<i>Captain Corporal John</i>.  When it was known
that the invading army had abandoned the attempt,
and had crossed the river, the men, wisely
considering that their services were no longer required
in Cornwall, and would be highly useful
on their farms, disbanded themselves during the
night without the formality of asking leave, so
that at morning parade only six appeared on the
ground. Such an unheard-of breach of military
discipline could not fail to excite the fierce indignation
of the worthy veteran; accordingly he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
vented his wrath in every oath, Gaelic or English,
within the range of his vocabulary. Peggy,
who witnessed the scene from her window, consoled
the incensed commander with "Och! John,
dear, don&#39;t let the devil get so great a hould of
ye as to be blaspheming like a heathen in that
fearful way; things are not so bad with you yet,
sure you have twice as many men under your
command as you had when I knew you first."</p>

<p class="indent">Having at last been relieved, I proceeded to
join on the Niagara frontier, and therefore marched
with a detachment of the Canadian Fencibles
to Kingston, where I was joined by a friend of
mine, an officer of the 100th, who was bound for
the same destination. We accordingly waited on
the Deputy Quarter Master General, and stated
the necessity of being furnished with land conveyance,
as the battle which must decide the campaign,
was hourly expected; but that gentleman
having newly acquired his dignity, it did not sit
easy upon him, and with great hauteur he flatly
refused us, and unless we chose to march it,
(about 200 miles,) we had no shift but to embark
in a batteau loaded with gunpowder, and rowed
by a party of De Watteville&#39;s regiment. This
gentleman, by the bye, afterwards distinguished
himself as a naturalist in Sir John Ross&#39; first
Polar expedition, and as a most appropriate reward
had the honor to stand god-father to a nondescript
gull, which bears his name unto this day.</p>

<p class="indent">In the batteau, therefore, we deposited ourselves,
and with six more in company proceeded
on our way, with such speed as a set of rowers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
who probably had never had an oar before in
their hands, could urge us. The wind though
light was ahead; but when we got about six
hours distance from Kingston, which perhaps
might amount to eighteen or twenty miles, all
we could do was to make head-way against it,
and as it looked as if there would be more of it,
sooner than less, I (who, from my superior nautical
experience, having been born and bred in a
sea-port town and acquired considerable dexterity
both in stealing boats and managing them
when stolen, was voted Commodore,) ordered
them under the lee of a little rocky island, and
carried their dangerous cargo about a hundred
yards from where we encamped, that is to say,
put the gunpowder at one end of the island and
ourselves at the other, hauled up the batteau,
lighted fires, and forming a camp of sails and
tarpaulins, waited the event. A squall did come
down the lake in very handsome style, embellished
with a sufficiency of spindrift to make us
thankful that we were under the lee of a rock
and covered overhead. The squall subsided into
a good steady gale, accompanied by a sea that
made it utterly impossible that we could have
proceeded even if the wind had been as favourable
as it was the contrary; we thus had the advantage
of enjoying two days of philosophical reflection
on a rock in Lake Ontario. On the third it
began to moderate, and my comrade and I took
one of the empty batteaus with a strong party,
and made us directly in shore as we could, and
had the good fortune to land about twelve miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
above Kingston, determined to make our way on
horseback, <i>coute qu&#39;il coute</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Any one who has only seen the roads of Canada
in the present day, can form but a very inadequate
idea of what they were then between
Kingston and Toronto; for a considerable part
of the way we were literally up to our saddle-flaps.
In those days all the horses along the
roads were taken up for Government, and an
officer receiving the <i>route</i> gave the proprietor an
order for so many horses so many miles, and the
nearest Commissary paid it; or he paid it, taking
a receipt which, when he showed it to the
Commissary at the end of his journey, was refunded.
We necessarily took the latter mode, seeing
we had no route to show, and therefore paid
our way ourselves. The officer who accompanied
me being like myself a subaltern, we found
we uniformly got the worst horses, as Major A.
or Colonel B. or some other "person of worship"
was expected, and the best must necessarily be
kept for him. It struck me therefore that if
"Captain" was a good travelling name, "General"
must be a much better; I proposed to my
companion that he should have the rank of Major
General "for the road only," and I volunteered
to act as Aide-de-camp. He liked the plan, but
objected that he was too young to look the character,
but that as I had a more commanding and
dignified presence, I should do General and he
Aide-de-camp, and as we were dressed in our surtouts
and forage caps, we were well aware that
we might easily pass with the uninitiated for any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
rank we might think proper to assume. Accordingly,
when we approached a halt where we were
to change horses, he rode briskly forward and
began to call lustily about him, as "one having
authority," for horses, and pointing to a very
active, stout looking pair, peremptorily ordered
them to be brought out and saddled; but the
man of the house excused himself by saying that
he "kept them horses for the sole use of Major B.
the Deputy Quarter Master General, and as he
had the conducting of the troops on the line of
march through which the road lay, and had it in
his power to put good jobs in his way, he was
not a man whom he could offend on slight
grounds."</p>

<p class="indent">"D&mdash;&mdash;n Major B!"  exclaimed the irreverent
and indignant A.D.C. "Would you set his will, or
that of fifty like him, against the positive orders
of the great General D. who has been sent out
by the Duke of Wellington to instruct Sir Gordon
Drummond how he is to conduct the campaign?
Sir, if by your neglect he is too late for
the battle that must soon be fought, you will be
answerable for it, and then hanging on your own
sign-post is the very mildest punishment you can
expect; it is the way we always settled such
matters in Spain." To this argument there could
be no answer, so the horses were led out just as
I came up&mdash;my A.D.C. with his hat in his hand
holding my stirrup as I mounted. This to those
who knew anything about the service would have
appeared a little <i>de trop</i>; but to the uninitiated,
of whom mine host was one, it only served to inspire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
him with the higher respect for the great
man his horse was about to have the honour to
carry.</p>

<p class="indent">So far things went on as well as could have
been wished; but in turning a corner in a young
pine wood about a mile from where we had started,
who should we meet full in the face but Major
B., (commonly called Beau B.) who was also a
captain in my own regiment. After the first salutation
he expressed his surprise that the man
should have given me his horses. I assured him
that I should not have got them, but that he had
a much better pair for him. This pacified him,
so after a few minutes&#39; conversation, (the A.D.C.
and guide keeping a respectful distance,) I
told him I had been made a general since I last
saw him. He did not see the point of the joke
at the time, but on taking leave he took off his
hat and bowing till his well brushed and perfumed
locks mixed with the hair of his horse&#39;s mane,
said, loud enough for the guide to hear him,
"General D., I have the honor to wish you a
very good morning." If there had been any misgivings
in the mind of the guide, this could not
fail to remove them. Immediately after he rode
up to me, and said that if I had no objections he
would ride forward, and make such arrangements
that there should be no delay in mounting me at
the next stage. To this I acceded with the most
gracious affability, so he rode on accordingly.
His zeal for the service might account for his
eagerness, yet I hope I will not be accounted uncharitable
when I suspected that the importance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
which attaches to the person who is first to communicate
an extraordinary piece of news, may
have had something to do with all this alacrity.
However this may be, it served my purpose, for
at every stage not a moment was lost, the news
flying like wild fire. I found horses ready at
every house, and never was for one moment delayed.</p>

<p class="indent">With my friend Beau B. the result was somewhat
different, for on arriving at the stage there
was nothing for him but our exhausted dog-tired
horses to mount, which in the state of the roads
would have been utter madness; so he had to
wait in a roadside inn, consoling himself with
what philosophy he could muster till they were
sufficiently recruited with food and rest to continue
their journey.</p>

<p class="indent">On this journey there occurred a circumstance
which, as it is intimately connected with the
secret history of the Province, deserves to be related.
It will be news to most of my neighbors
that the Province of Canada has a <i>secret history</i>
of its own, or they may suppose that it may contain
some such tit-bits as the secret history of
the Court of St. Petersburg in the days of Catharine;
but I am sorry to say that our secret history
affords nothing so <i>piquante</i>; it only relates
to the diplomacy of the Court of St. James,
with its effects on the Court of the Chateau St.
Louis.</p>

<p class="indent">In those days Sir George Prevost filled the
vice-regal chair of Her Majesty&#39;s dominions in
British North America, and a more incompetent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
Viceroy could hardly have been selected for such
trying times. Timid at all times, despairing of
his resources, he was afraid to venture anything;
and when he did venture, like an unskilful hunter,
he spurred his horse spiritedly at the fence, and
while the animal rose he suddenly checked him&mdash;baulked
him in the leap he could have easily
cleared, and landed himself in the ditch. Thus he
acted at Sackett&#39;s Harbour and thus at Plattsburg,
where he was in possession of the forts
when he ordered the retreat to be sounded, and
ran away out of one side of the town while the
enemy were equally busy in evacuating it at the
other. But to my story. Late on the evening of
our first day&#39;s journey, and therefore somewhere
midway between Kingston and Toronto, we overtook
an officer of Sir George Prevost&#39;s Staff. He
asked us why we were riding so fast? We told
him, to be present at the coming battle. He told
us we might save ourselves the trouble, as there
would be no battle till he was there, and hinted
perhaps not then; and strongly recommended
that, instead of pushing on through such roads
during the night, we should stop at a house he
pointed out to us, and where he was going.
Thinking, however, that a battle was not always
at the option of one party, we determined to push
on, while he turned up to a good looking two
story white framed house on the lake side of the
road. Many years after, the late Mr. Galt was
employed to advocate the War Losses in Canada
with His Majesty&#39;s Government. In one of his
conferences with the Colonial Secretary, the latter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
stated that everything that could be done had
been done for the defence of the Province, and
that it never had been the intention either of the
Imperial or Colonial Government to abandon it.
Mr. Galt then placed in his hands a paper purporting
to be a copy of a despatch from Sir
George Prevost to Sir Gordon Drummond, ordering
him to withdraw his forces from the upper
part of the Province, and to concentrate them to
cover Kingston. The Secretary then, turning to
Galt, said rather sternly:</p>

<p class="indent">"Sir, you could not have come fairly by this
copy of a private despatch?"</p>

<p class="indent">Galt calmly replied, "My Lord, however this
paper was come by at first, I came honestly
enough by it, for it was sent to me with other
papers to assist me in advocating the claims of
those who have suffered in the war; but I thank
your Lordship for admitting that it is a copy of
a despatch whether private or public."</p>

<p class="indent">His Lordship felt that, in his haste to criminate,
he had allowed his diplomacy to be taken by
surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">Galt told me this story, and I then told him
my meeting the officer, who undoubtedly was the
bearer of the despatch; he confessed to me that
it was at that house and on that night that the
despatches were abstracted from that Staff Officer&#39;s
sabre-tasche, copied, resealed and returned.
Of course he never would tell me who were the
perpetrators; but if a certain Colonel of Militia
(who was not then present, but attending his
duty on the frontier) were now alive,&mdash;poor fellow!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
he came by an untimely end&mdash;I have no
doubt but he could throw some light on the subject.</p>

<p class="indent">We continued to be furnished with good horses
till we arrived at Toronto, (then York,) for
there being then moonlight we rode twenty
hours out of the twenty-four, and it appeared
that we had advanced for the two last days (for
the first day we only made one stage) at the rate
of seventy-five miles per day, which, considering
the state of the roads, was far from being amiss.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, me! what perils do environ</span>
<span class="i0">The man that meddles with cold iron!</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Luckily the moment we arrived at Toronto, we
were informed that a gun-brig was about to sail
for Niagara, on board which we were shipped.
About sun-set we sailed, and the wind being fair,
we arrived in the mouth of the Niagara river at
daylight, and lost no time in ordering horses;
and while they were getting ready, we were anxiously
employed in examining and cross-examining
witnesses as to the contradictory reports
that were in circulation as to a battle. All we
could elicit was, that there had been some fighting,
for many had heard from Queenston Heights
the noise both of artillery and musketry. Some
said we had been defeated, and were in full retreat
on Niagara; others that we had cut the
enemy to pieces, and that the few that were left
were busy crossing to their own side. Of course,
as in most matters of rumor, both reports were
partly true and partly false. We had obtained a
victory, but lost severely in so doing; and the
enemy, in consequence of the masterly arrangements
of Major General Scott, one of the best
soldiers in the American Army, (and one of the
most gentlemanly men I ever met with,) had retired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
on Fort Brie; and a body of our troops,
under Major General Convan of the Royals, had
pressed hard upon them, and had he not been
disabled by a wound, it is the general opinion,
would have followed them into the Fort. The
first of the particulars we were told by an officer
who had come from the field on the spur, with
the despatches, and he advised me as a friend
(for we were old acquaintances) to stay where I
was, and get my hospital in readiness, for, he assured
me, that from the manner our Regiment
had been handled, I would have quite enough to
do at home without going abroad to look for adventures.
Accordingly, upon inquiring where my
wounded were to be put, I was shown a ruinous
fabric, built of logs, called Butler&#39;s Barracks, from
having been built during the revolutionary war
by Butler&#39;s Rangers for their temporary accommodation.
Nothing could be worse constructed
for an hospital for wounded men&mdash;not that it was
open to every wind that blew, for at midsummer
in Canada that is rather an advantage; but
there was a great want of room, so that many
had to be laid on straw on the floor, and these
had the best of it, for their comrades were put
into berths one above another as in a transport
or packet, where it was impossible to get round
them to dress their wounds, and their removal
gave them excrutiating pain.</p>

<p class="indent">In the course of the morning I had my hands
full enough. Our Surgeon had gone to Scotland
in a state of health which rendered recovery hopeless,
and our senior assistant, naturally of a delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
constitution, and suffering under disease at
the time of the action, had the last of his strength
exhausted in bringing his wounded down. Waggon
after waggon arrived, and before mid-day I
found myself in charge of two hundred and twenty
wounded, including my own Regiment, prisoners
and militia, with no one to assist me but my
hospital serjeant, who, luckily for me, was a man
of sound sense and great experience, who made a
most able second; but with all this the charge
was too much for us, and many a poor fellow
had to submit to amputation whose limb might
have been preserved had there been only time to
take reasonable care of it. But under the circumstances
of the case it was necessary to convert a
troublesome wound into a simple one, or to lose
the patient&#39;s life from want of time to pay him
proper attention.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the many blunders of this blundering
war, was that the Staff of the Army was never
where it was wanted. The Medical and Commissariat
Staffs, for instance, were congregated at
the headquarters at Quebec, where they were in
redundancy, with nothing for them to do, while a
Staff Surgeon and an Hospital Mate were all
that was allowed for the Army of the Right,&mdash;men
who must have been active beyond all precedent
if they could keep the office business, the
accounts and returns square, without even attempting
to interfere with the practice; and all
this at a time too, when there was hardly a regiment
in the field that had its full complement of
medical officers.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
There is hardly on the face of the earth a less
enviable situation than that of an Army Surgeon
after a battle&mdash;worn out and fatigued in body and
mind, surrounded by suffering, pain and
misery, much of which he knows it is not in his
power to heal or even to assuage. While the battle
lasts these all pass unnoticed, but they come
before the medical man afterwards in all their
sorrow and horror, stripped of all the excitement
of the "heady fight."</p>

<p class="indent">It would be a useful lesson to cold-blooded politicians,
who calculate on a war costing so many
lives and so many limbs as they would calculate
on a horse costing so many pounds&mdash;or to the
thoughtless at home, whom the excitement of a
gazette, or the glare of an illumination, more
than reconciles to the expense of a war&mdash;to witness
such a scene, if only for one hour. This simple
and obvious truth was suggested to my mind
by the exclamation of a poor woman. I had
two hundred and twenty wounded turned in upon
me that morning, and among others an American
farmer, who had been on the field either as a militia
man or a camp follower. He was nearly sixty
years of age, but of a most Herculean frame.
One ball had shattered his thigh bone, and another
lodged in his body, the last obviously mortal.
His wife, a respectable elderly looking woman,
came over under a flag of truce, and immediately
repaired to the hospital, where she found
her husband lying on a truss of straw, writhing
in agony, for his sufferings were dreadful. Such
an accumulation of misery seemed to have stunned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
her, for she ceased wailing, sat down on the
ground, and taking her husband&#39;s head on her
lap, continued long, moaning and sobbing, while
the tears flowed fast down her face; she seemed
for a considerable time in a state of stupor, till
awakened by a groan from her unfortunate husband,
she clasped her hands, and looking wildly
around, exclaimed, "O that the King and the
President were both here this moment to see the
misery their quarrels lead to&mdash;they surely would
never go to war again without a cause that they
could give as a reason to God at the last day,
for thus destroying the creatures that He hath
made in his own image." In half an hour the
poor fellow ceased to suffer.</p>

<p class="indent">I never underwent such fatigue as I did for the
first week at Butler&#39;s Barracks. The weather
was intensely hot, the flies were in myriads, and
lighting on the wounds, deposited their eggs, so
that maggots were bred in a few hours, producing
dreadful irritation, so that long before I could
go round dressing the patients, it was necessary
to begin again; and as I had no assistant but
my serjeant, our toil was incessant. For two
days and two nights, I never sat down; when
fatigued I sent my servant down to the river for a
change of linen, and having dined and dressed,
went back to my work quite refreshed. On the
morning of the third day, however, I fell asleep
on my feet, with my arm embracing the post of
one of the berths. It was found impossible to
awaken me, so a truss of clean straw was laid
on the floor, on which I was deposited, and an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
hospital rug thrown over me; and there I slept
soundly for five hours without ever turning.</p>

<p class="indent">My instructions were, as soon as a man could
be safely removed, to ship him for York, and
as the whole distance was by water conveyance,
and there were ships of war always in readiness,
and as my men were eminently uncomfortable
where they were, I very soon thinned my hospital,
and the few that remained over were sent to
a temporary general hospital, and I was despatched
to Chippawa in the neighborhood of the
Falls of Niagara.</p>

<p class="indent">My duty here was to keep a kind of a medical
boarding house. The sick and wounded from the
Army were forwarded to me in spring waggons,
and I took care of them during the night, and in
the morning I forwarded them on to Niagara by
the same conveyance, so that my duty commenced
about sun-set, and terminated at sun-rise. By
this arrangement I had the whole of the day to
myself, and in the vicinity of the Falls there was
no difficulty in employing it agreeably. My first
business on my arrival, on a beautiful summer
afternoon, was to visit the Table Rock. My first
sight of the Falls most woefully disappointed me,&mdash;it
was certainly grander than any fall I had
ever seen, those of the Clyde included; but it was
not on that scale of magnificence I had been led
to expect, the opposite shore seemed within a
stone&#39;s throw, and the height of the Fall not very
great. I walked to the edge of the rock, and
seated myself with my legs dangling over, and
blessed my stars that I was not a man to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
thrown into ecstacies and raptures merely because
other people had been so. After about a
quarter of an hour&#39;s contemplation I resolved to
return to my quarters, and previous to rising, I
bent forward and looked straight down. Below
me were two men fishing, diminished by the distance&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The fishermen that walked upon the beach</span>
<span class="i0">Appeared like mice."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">This immediately gave me a notion of the height
I was perched upon; a sense of sickness and giddiness
came over me, and, like Edgar, I prudently
resolved&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"I&#39;ll look no more,</span>
<span class="i0">Lest the brain turn, and the deficient sight</span>
<span class="i0">Topple down headlong."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">But I did not make my retreat in a manner quite
so dignified as could have been wished, for in
coming down the bank I had unslung my sword,
and was carrying it in my hand; it I pitched
backwards over my head, and throwing myself
first on the broad of my back, I rolled over half
a dozen times, till I thought myself a sufficient
distance from the verge of the precipice to get
upon my legs, and it will easily be believed I was
in no hurry to return to my former position.</p>

<p class="indent">I then set on foot a series of experiments to
ascertain the width of the Falls, by throwing
stones across, but by some extraordinary fatality
they seemed to drop from my hand into the
enormous cauldron that boiled and smoked below.
Next day I came armed with an Indian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
bow, but the arrows met with no greater success
than the stones&mdash;they, too, dropt as if impelled
by a child&#39;s force; and it was not till after
I looked at the Falls in every aspect that I convinced
myself that they were such a stupendous
work of nature as they really are. The fact is,
there is nothing at hand to compare them with,
and a man must see them often, and from every
different point of view, to have any proper conception
of the nature of them. I never heard of
any one except Mrs. Boyle Corbett who was satisfied
with seeing the Falls from her bed-room
window while dressing for dinner; but I have
often been amused, while staying at the hotel
there, to see a succession of respectable people
come from Buffalo to Chippawa by steam, take
the stage that stops an hour at the Falls, dine,
and see them, and start for Queenston, quite convinced
that they had seen everything worth seeing
in the neighborhood. Getting tired of the inactive
life I was leading, I applied to get into the
field, and it luckily so happened that another
medical man had as great a desire to quit it as I
to get into it; accordingly, an exchange was soon
agreed upon&mdash;he being duly installed in the Chippawa
hospital, and I receiving the route to join
the Army before Fort Erie.</p>

<p class="indent">The leaguer before Fort Erie had been always
called the "Camp," and I certainly expected that,
like other camps, it would have been provided
with tents; but in this I was mistaken. It was
rather a bivouac than a camp, the troops sheltering
themselves under some branches of trees that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
only collected the scattered drops of rain, and
sent them down in a stream on the heads of the
inhabitants, and as it rained incessantly for two
months, neither clothes nor bedding could be kept
dry. I, though a young soldier, showed myself
an old one, for my friend Tom F&mdash;&mdash; having rather
a better hut than his neighbors, I took up my
quarters there, and his bed being raised on forked
sticks, I placed my own under it, so that the
rain had to penetrate through his bed clothes
and mattress before it could reach me.</p>

<p class="indent">This arrangement did admirably for some
time, till one night we were visited by the most
tremendous thunder storm I ever witnessed in
this or any other country, and accompanied with
a deluge of rain, that might have done credit to
Noah&#39;s flood. The hut was very soon swimming,
and I was awoke by my bed being overflowed,
and started up to get out, but the water that
flooded the floor softened the earth in which the
forked sticks that supported Tom&#39;s bed were
driven, and it falling forward jammed me in
among the wet bed clothes, where I was nearly
drowned, till Tom starting to his feet allowed me
to raise the wreck and crawl on all-fours from
under it.</p>

<p class="indent">I may here remark what has always struck me
as a great deficiency in the military education of
the British Army&mdash;they are too much taken care
of by their officers, and never taught to take
care of themselves. In quarters their every motion
is under the surveillance of their officers&mdash;the
Captain and Subaltern of the day visit them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
each twice a day, and the Commanding Officer
and one or other of the Majors frequently, to
say nothing of the Surgeon and the Captain of
their Company, who, if he (as sometimes happens)
is a man possessed of a spirit of fidgetty
zeal for the service, actually harasses them to
death by his kind attention to their wants.</p>

<p class="indent">It must be certified that their room is duly
swept and cleaned, their bedding regularly made
up and folded, their meals properly dressed, and
it is not even left to their own discretion to eat
them when dressed, but an officer must see and
certify that fact.</p>

<p class="indent">Their shaving, their ablutions, their cleaning
their shoes and clothes, all come under the same
strict supervision, so that at last they get into
the notion that their comfort, cleanliness, feeding
and clothing, all are the duty and business of
their officers, they having no interest in the matter,
and that what they are not ordered to do
for their own relief they may leave undone. In
the sister service this is not so. A sailor will
mend his clothes, will leave his hammock properly
fitted, his bedding properly made, and his
comforts so far as depends upon himself, properly
cared for, whether his officers order it or not.
The result of all this excessive care and attention
is that you make men mere children. When the
soldier leaves his clean comfortable barracks in
England and is put into the field, where he has
few or none of the accommodations he had at
home, he is utterly helpless, and his officer on
whom he leant, is just as helpless when a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
state of things arises, as he can possibly be. All
this was most fully illustrated before Fort Erie.
The line might nearly as well have slept in the
open air. The incorporated Militia, on the contrary,
erected shanties, far superior, in warmth,
tightness and comfort, to any canvas tent. De
Watteville&#39;s regiment, which was recruited, chiefly
from the prison hulks, consisted of all the nations
of Europe, but all of them had served in
the armies of Napoleon, and all of them had
there learned how to make the best of a bad bargain.
These, though they had not the skill in the
axe inherent in their brethren of the Militia, took
down hemlock boughs (a species of the pine,
"<i>pinus canadensis</i>,") and cutting off the tails of
them, made thatched wigwams, perfectly weatherproof;
and though they could not equal the
Canadian Militia in <i>woodcraft</i>, they greatly excelled
them in gastronomic lore; and thus, while
our fellows had no better shift than to frizzle
their rations of salt provisions on the ends of
their ramrods, these being practical botanists,
sent out one soldier from each mess, who gathered
a haversack full of wild pot herbs, with which
and a little flour their ration was converted into
a capital kettle of soup.</p>

<p class="indent">I shall have occasion to show hereafter how
easily those camp habits may be acquired; meantime
I have only to remark that, were they generally
understood, an army might often be kept
in the field in an infinitely more serviceable condition
than it now is, and the prevalence of ague
and dysentery in a body of men exposed to hardship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
and privation, if not totally arrested, might
at least be very much diminished. I lately saw
a very clever article on this subject by Sir J. E.
Alexander of the 32nd Regt., now quartered at
London, U.C., and I wrote him a very long and
a very prosy letter thereanent. My positions, if
I remember aright, were, first&mdash;That every Regiment
in Canada should be made a Light Infantry
Regiment, insomuch as they ought to be taught
to understand and obey the bugle; secondly, that
they should be taught the use of the axe, without
which a Regiment is absolutely helpless in the
woods, and this might be done by making them
chop their own firewood, and giving them the
money that is otherwise given to the contractor:
and thirdly, that they should be taken into the
woods for a month every summer, with a party of
woodsmen to teach them how to erect shanties,
cut fire-wood and provide for themselves in such
a situation. Even the Commissariat Department
(the most important in modern warfare) may be
dispensed with by able woods-men. Sir William
Johnson marched his Regiment, who were all
woods-men, from the Mohawk River to Fort Niagara,
through the woods, requiring no other support,
on that long line of march, than their rifles
were amply sufficient to supply them with.</p>

<p class="indent">When I arrived at Fort Erie, I found myself appointed
to the very service I would have chosen
had I had the right of choosing. A corps of six
flank companies was organized under the command
of Lieutenant Colonel Drummond, of Keltie,
then commandant of the 104th Regiment.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
Colonel Drummond was everything that could
be required in a soldier; brave, generous, open-hearted
and good natured, he added to all these
the talent of a first-rate tactitian; and if at times
eccentricities broke out through all these, any one
who knew him must have agreed with his clansman,
and I believe kinsman, Sir Gordon Drummond,
that "all these eccentricities would one
day mellow down into sound common sense, and
that Keltie would be an honor to the service."
Alas! his prophecy was destined never to be fulfilled&mdash;that
was his last campaign, and he fell in
it as a brave man and a soldier would wish to
fall, a death far less to be pitied than envied. But
I am anticipating. We were divided into three
brigades&mdash;let not the old soldier suppose that
these were such brigades as are generally in the
army. Our force never amounted to 9,000 men,
including artillery, cavalry and militia, and these
took their tour of piquet duty in rotation, so
that we had one day of duty, were relieved the
next, and on the fourth again took our turn.
This, all things considered, especially alarms and
skirmishes, when we all turned out, was pretty
hard work, but we were in high spirits, and it
never affected us. One of the great drawbacks
of the service in Canada was that we got the
rubbish of every department in the army. Any
man whom The Duke deemed unfit for the Peninsula
was considered as quite good enough for the
Canadian market, and in nothing was this more
conspicuous than in our Engineer Department.
Without the semblance of a battering train, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
was deemed expedient to besiege Fort Erie, and
the ground was occupied, parties sent in advance,
and batteries ordered to be constructed. Our
first essay in this line was a battery on the main
road leading to the Fort, which was to breach
the strong stone building in the centre of it, on
which were mounted, if I recollect rightly, one
iron 24-pounder, one 18-pounder and two brass
field 24-pounders. I have never seen before or
since, any like them, but they were of the time
of George II., and were admirable guns in the
field, though not quite the best that could be used
for breaching the wall of a fort. A brass and an
iron mortar were afterwards added to this most
efficient battering train; the latter, however,
having no bed, was placed in one of oak, which
it split almost as often as it was fired. After
much skirmishing with the enemy and the covering
parties, the battery was at last opened, and
gentle reader! if ever you saw what is termed
hopping bowling at cricket you may have some
idea how our fire operated. I very much doubt
if one shot in ten reached the rampart at all, and
the fortunate exceptions that struck the stone
building at which they were aimed, rebounded
from its sides as innocuous as tennis balls.</p>

<p class="indent">The fact is the distance had been miscalculated,
and we were attempting to breach a wall at
a distance that it was scarcely possible to hit it.
The enemy knew their distance better, and managed
to pitch shot and shell among us in a way
that was anything but pleasant.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
I remember one day while I was in the battery,
admiring our abortive attempts to do any mischief,
while a gun of the enemy was practising
with the most admirable precision on us, Mr. K.,
of the Glengarries, lounged into the battery, and
casually asked the Commanding Engineer how
far we were from the Fort. He replied about
seven hundred yards. Mr. K. said he thought
double the distance would be nearer the mark;&mdash;this
brought on a dispute, which Mr. K. offered
to settle by either cutting a fuse or laying a gun
for the supposed distance. To this it was replied
that both the powder and the fuses were bad,
and no faith could be had in them. Mr. K. then
asked leave to lay the 24-pounder, and the Engineer,
with a sneer, looking at his green jacket,
observed, that there was some difference between
a rifle and a 24-pounder; however, Mr. K. then
himself on the trail of the gun, brought out the
coign further than it had been before, and from
the orders he gave to the artillery even, showed,
at least, that he knew the words of command in
working a gun. The presiding Engineer, seeing
the elevation he was taking, asked him if he was
aiming at the truck of the flagstaff of the Fort.
He replied, no&mdash;the site of the embrazure would
be high enough for him. The gun was fired, and
the ball entered the sand bags about a foot below
the mark. He then asked leave to try a second
shot. He laid the gun with great care, and
took a long while to do it,&mdash;at last he gave the
word "fire," away went the ball, and driving the
sand up from the site of the embrazure, took the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
enemy&#39;s gun on the transom, and capsized it.
"Pray, sir," said the Engineer, "where might
you have learned to lay guns?" "At Woolwich,"
was the reply, "where I was three years Serjeant
Major of Artillery."</p>

<p class="indent">It was then resolved that another battery
should be erected some hundreds of yards in advance,
and to the right of the first. Accordingly,
our brigade was sent out to drive the enemy&#39;s
piquets out of the wood in our front, and establish
parties to cover the workmen.</p>

<p class="indent">This duty was performed in good style, but
with considerable loss on our part, for in a wood
the advancing party always acts to disadvantage,
as the retreating can fire from under cover,
and retreat in the smoke; whereas the advancing
party must necessarily expose himself somewhat,
the quantum of exposure depending much on his
knowledge of his business in advancing in such a
way as will give his antagonists as little chance
as may be of taking a steady aim at him.</p>

<p class="indent">The ground was accordingly chosen, and the
third effort commenced. The enemy were aware
of what we were about, so they kept up a constant
fire of round shot and shells upon the working
parties. The direction of their practice was
admirable, but they seemed to have altogether
lost their knowledge of elevation, for their shot
was uniformly over our heads. At last the battery
was declared ready to open, but, as it was
masked by a considerable belt of trees, these had,
of course, to be felled, and that required a strong
covering, and an equally strong working party.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
If the enemy had failed with their round shot
against the men in the trenches, they were infinitely
more fortunate with their grape against
the covering and working party. This was by far
the bloodiest bush skirmish we had. The party
with which I was, though not 120 strong, had six
killed and about thirty wounded; however, we
stuck obstinately to it, and at last our object
was achieved. The battery was unmasked, and
the Lord have mercy on the defenders of the
Fort, for we would have none! "Mistakes will
creep into the best regulated families." When all
this profuse waste of life, time and labor had
been gone into, it was discovered that the battery
had been erected without taking the levels,
and that a rise of ground in front of it prevented
us even from seeing the Fort. This at once demonstrated
that the battery was useless, and explained
the reason why the American shot had
been so innocuous. During the whole time we lay
before Fort Erie, bush-skirmishing was an every
day&#39;s occurrence, and though the numbers lost in
each of these affairs may seem but trifling, yet
the aggregate of men put <i>hors de combat</i> in a
force so small as ours became very serious in the
long run. They generally commenced with some
accidental rencontre of videttes&mdash;their firing
brought out the piquet, then the brigade on duty,
and then, not unfrequently, the brigade next for
duty. I think, on a fair average of three months,
I enjoyed this amusement about three times a
week.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
Excepting only a melée of cavalry, a bush skirmish
is the only aspect in which modern warfare
appears in anything picturesque. Look at all
attempts at painting a modern battle, and unless
the painter takes such a distance as to render
everything indistinct, you have nothing but a
series of stiff, hard, regular, straight lines, that
might represent a mathematical diagram in uniform.
Not so with light infantry in a wood.
There a man ceases to be merely a part of a machine,
or a point in a long line. Both his personal
safety and his efficiency depend on his own
knowledge and tact. To stand straight upright
and be shot at is no part of his duty; his great
object is to annoy the enemy, and keep himself
safe; and so far was this carried by the tacticians
of the Prussian school, that in a German
Contingent, which served on this continent during
the revolutionary war, a yager has been flogged
for <i>getting himself wounded</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps there can be no military scene more
fit for the pencil than a body of light infantry
awaiting an attack. The variety of attitude necessary
to obtain cover&mdash;the breathless silence&mdash;the
men attentive by eye and ear&mdash;every glance
(furtively lowered) directed to the point&mdash;some
kneeling, some lying down, and some standing
straight behind a tree&mdash;the officer with his silver
whistle in his hand, ready to give the signal to
commence firing, and the bugle boy looking earnestly
in his officer&#39;s face waiting for the next
order. This is worth painting, which cannot, by
any one having a decent regard for truth, be said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
of the base reliefs that we see on the tombs of
heroes, of a line of men marching in step, each
with his bayonet levelled at precisely the same
angle, in a manner that would draw forth the
enthusiastic approbation of the shade of Sir
David Dundas, but which no effort of the genius
of sculptor or painter could even render more
tolerable, than a well executed representation of
the same quantity of park pales.</p>

<p class="indent">This species of warfare necessarily draws forth
the individual talent of the soldier. I once saw
a soldier of the 32nd take two American sentries
prisoners, by placing his cap and great coat on a
bush, and while they were busy firing at his image
and superscription, he fetch&#39;d a circuit, got
behind them, waited till both of their firelocks
were discharged, and then drove them before him
into the picquet guard.</p>

<p class="indent">The Glengarry Regiment being provincials, possessed
many excellent shots. They were not
armed with the rifle, but with what I greatly prefer
to that arm, the double sighted light infantry
musket. A rifle is by no means suited for a
day&#39;s fighting; when it gets foul from repeated
firing it is difficult even to hammer the ball down,
and the same foulness which clogs the barrel
must injure the precision of the ball. The well
made smooth barrel on the contrary, is to a certain
degree scoured by every discharge, and can
stand sixty rounds without the necessity of cleaning.
Nor is it in the precision of its aim for any
useful purpose inferior to the rifle, that is to say
in the hands of a man who knows how to use it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
I have seen a Sergeant of the Glengarries who
would allow you to pick out a musket from any
of the corps, and let him load it, when he would
knock the head off a pigeon on the top of the
highest tree in the forest.</p>

<p class="indent">In the British Army one would suppose that
the only use of a musket was understood to be
that it could carry a bayonet at the end of it.
The quantity of powder allowed to be expended
in teaching the men the use of their principal
weapon is fifteen rounds per annum. Now, suppose
such a limitation was placed on sportsmen,
is it possible to conceive that on the twelfth of
August, or the first of September, there could be
found one man who could bring down a grouse
or a partridge? No; the officers in command of
corps should have an unlimited power in the expenditure
of ammunition, and should only be
made answerable for their Regiment being efficient
in their practice when called into the field.</p>

<p class="indent">In this regiment there were a father and three
sons, American U. E. Loyalists, all of them
crack shots. In a covering party one day the
father and one of the sons were sentries on the
same point. An American rifleman dropped a
man to his left, but in so doing exposed himself,
and almost as a matter of course, was instantly
dropped in his turn by the unerring aim of the
father. The enemy were at that moment being
driven in, so the old man of course (for it was a
ceremony seldom neglected,) went up to rifle his
victim. On examining his features he discovered
that it was his own brother. Under any circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
this would have horrified most men, but
a Yankee has much of the stoic in him, and is
seldom deprived of his equanimity. He took possession
of his valuables, consisting of an old silver
watch and a clasp knife, his rifle and appointments,
coolly remarking, that it "served
him right for fighting for the rebels, when all the
rest of his family fought for King George." It
appeared that during the revolutionary war his
father and all his sons had taken arms in the
King&#39;s cause, save this one, who had joined the
Americans. They had never met him from that
period till the present moment; but such is the
virulence of political rancour, that it can overcome
all the ties of nature.</p>

<p class="indent">With all our hardships and privations there
was nowhere to be met with a merrier set of fellows
than in the camp before Fort Erie. One of
the chief promoters of this was worthy Billy R.
of the King&#39;s, who, to all the qualifications of a
most accomplished soldier, added all the lightheartedness
and wit of an Irishman.</p>

<p class="indent">There was in the camp an old thorn, up which
a wild vine had climbed, and then descended in
long branches to the ground, forming a natural
bower impervious to the rays of the sun. The
root of this tree was Billy&#39;s favourite seat (for he
was too much of the Falstaff build to be more
peripatetic than was absolutely necessary) and
no sooner was he seated than a group of officers
was established around him, and to these he
would tell funny stories and crack jokes by the
hour together. He was appointed to the command
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
of the Incorporated Militia, and a more judicious
selection could not have been made, not
only on account of his military talents, but his
invincible good temper and good humour, which
endeared him to the men, and made them take
a pleasure and a pride in obeying his orders and
attending to his instructions. Some idea may be
formed of his talents in this way, when I state
that in the course of a very few months, he rendered
a body of raw lads from the plough-tail as
efficient a corps as any in the field.</p>

<p class="indent">Towards the end of the business, when his men
were acting as light infantry, he was knocked off
his horse by a ball, which struck him in the forehead
and came out over the ear. This would
have knocked the life out of most men, but it did
knock the wit out of Billy. He was raised and
placed in a blanket, his eyes still fixed on his
men, who he saw were pushing on in a way to
expose themselves. "Stop till I spake to the
boys," said he to the men, who were carrying
him off the field; "Boys!" shouted he, "I have
only one remark to make, and that is, that a
stump or a log will stand a leaden bullet better
than the best of yees, and therefore give them
the honor to be your front rank men." Poor
Billy survived this severe wound many years, but
at last its effects began to tell. He became paralytic
of the lower extremities, and had to be carried
from place to place; but his wit and good
humor never forsook him. He died in the Isle of
Wight in 1827, on his way to Canada to draw his
land.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
One day, when relieved from piquet, I announced
to Col. P., who commanded our brigade, that
I had discovered a short way through the woods
to the camp, and accordingly I led the way, he
and Captain F., of the Glengarries, following.
By some fatality I mistook the path, and took a
wrong turn, so that instead of finding the camp
we came right on the top of an American piquet,
which opened fire upon us at about fifty yards
distance. Being use to this we were behind trees
in a moment, and the next were scampering in
different directions at greater or less angles from
the enemy. It may well be supposed I did not
wait on our brigadier, during the time we were
off duty, to receive thanks for my services as a
guide, nor when we did go on duty again was I
at all anxious to obtrude myself upon him; indeed
I kept as far from him as I could, but in
going his rounds at daylight he came up with me
seated by a piquet fire at the extreme left of the
line. He saluted me most graciously, alluded to
our late exploit as a good joke, and asked me to
breakfast with him. "Ho, ho," thinks I, "he has
forgotten it all, and I&#39;m forgiven&mdash;this is as it
should be." Lounging about after breakfast, and
talking over indifferent matters, a sputtering
fire began a little to our left, and the Colonel ordering
a look out on the right, proceeded, followed
by me, to the scene of action. We soon
saw that this was the point of attack, so he sent
me to order up the reserve. This done I rejoined
him, and found him standing coolly giving his
orders in the middle of a whistling of bullets, far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
too thick to be pleasant. I stood by his side for
some minutes, thankful that none of these missiles
had a billet on us, when on a sudden I felt
a severe sharp pain from my brow to the back
of my head at the same moment the Colonel exclaimed:
"By G&mdash;d! you are shot through the
head." I sunk upon one knee, and taking off my
forage cap felt along my head for blood, but none
was to be found. "It is only a graze," said I.
"Colonel, is there any mark?" "Yes," said he,
"there is a red mark, but not from a ball, it
came from my switch. You gave me a d&mdash;l of a
fright the other day&mdash;now I have given you one,
so we are quits."</p>

<p class="indent">Weeks passed at this kind of warfare, that
served no purpose to the parties except to harass
one another, and mutually to thin our ranks.
The enemy determined on a grand attack, that,
but for an accident, would have finished the campaign
and our army together. They collected all
the force they could raise, giving the militia a
long exemption from playing at soldiers in their
own country for one day&#39;s active exertion in ours.
They at the same time marched a body of troops
down their own side of the river, to cross and
take us in rear. The time was altogether well
chosen. The principal part of the brigade on
duty was De Watteville&#39;s regiment, who being
foreigners, and formerly soldiers of Napoleon,
could not have any very ardent desire for a victory
on our side. The day was cloudy, with a
continued drizzling rain. In the forenoon the
troops from the fort were marched out in small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
parties, and stationed in rear of the piquets, and
towards the afternoon all was in readiness.</p>

<p class="indent">A sudden and unexpected attack was made.
The out ports were forced&mdash;the battery on the
right stormed, and the guns disabled; the second
battery was also stormed, and the wheels of one
gun cut to pieces, and those of a second injured,
when two companies of the 82nd, under Captain
Pattison, rushed up to the assistance of the
piquet which was guarding it. They poured a
volley into the mass of the enemy, who were
huddled together into so small a space that they
could not return it. Pattison immediately sprung
forward, and called out to the American officer
in command to surrender, as resistance would
only cause loss of life and could do no good. He
did give an order to ground arms, and some of
his men were in the act of doing so, when an
American soldier raised his rifle and shot Pattison
through the heart. In one moment a charge
was made by the 82nd into the battery, and
every soul in it put to the bayonet, amounting,
I think, to upwards of two hundred men.</p>

<p class="indent">By this time the alarm was given in the camp,
and the men, without waiting for orders, rushed
out&mdash;their officers, who were at dinner, followed
at speed. The action became general, and the
enemy, finding that their object in destroying the
batteries had failed, returned in some confusion.</p>

<p class="indent">It is said that in war any new weapon, or any
new manoeuvre, strikes the enemy with terror,
and here we had an instance of it. A body of
the 82nd were opposed to a party of riflemen in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
the wood. The Captain commanding, to the utter
astonishment of all of us old bush-whackers,
gave orders to charge, and the order was executed
in a very spirited style. This we thought
was consigning our men to inevitable destruction;
but no such thing: the riflemen had no
more idea of a bayonet being pointed at them
than they had of being swallowed up by an
earthquake; and when the smoke cleared away,
and they saw the 82nd within twenty yards of
them, moving on at the "pas de charge," it
shook their nerves,&mdash;they fired, to be sure, but
with little effect, and then ran&mdash;they were too
late, however. The flat-foots got within <i>their</i>
deadly range, that is, bayonet&#39;s length&mdash;they
<i>skivered</i> many of them, and others were shot at
two muskets&#39; length, and driven out of the
woods to the esplanade of the Fort, where they
were treated with a parting volley; and the guns
of the Fort immediately opening on us, we took
the hint, and withdrew under the cover of the
woods.</p>

<p class="indent">I, like the rest of the dining parties, was
alarmed by the firing, and ran to the trenches.
On my road I met with about twenty of the men
of my own Regiment, and took them with me,
being guided to where the fire was thickest by
the noise. I found myself along with my friend,
Mautass, a Soc Chief, and his Indians. I have
had an opportunity of seeing bush-fighting in the
Indian fashion. It seemed to me to be a point
with them at every discharge of their rifle to
shift their position, and whenever they knocked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
a fellow over, their yelling was horrible. I was
close to Mautass himself, and whenever he performed
this feat, after giving the triumphal yell,
he jumped behind a tree, and seemed to be engaged
in prayer&mdash;perhaps to thank the great
Spirit for his success, or as likely to petition him
that he might knock over a few more.</p>

<p class="indent">When the enemy retired, the Indians who had
shown so much wariness in the fight, and had
talked to me of the folly of my young men exposing
themselves, suddenly seemed to lose all
their caution, and bounded forward with a horrible
yell, threw themselves on the retreating enemy
with their tomahawks, and were soon out of
our sight; but as we advanced, we saw they left
their trace behind them in sundry cleft skulls.&mdash;They
also, when their opponents were from fifteen
to twenty yards in advance of them, threw
their tomahawks with unerring aim and great
force, burying the head of the hatchet up to the
eye in the body of their opponents.</p>

<p class="indent">I afterwards requested the Chief to show me
how he threw the tomahawk. He accordingly
cut a small chip out of the bark of a tree, and
standing some fourteen yards off, and taking his
tomahawk with its pole to the front, he threw it,
and it was buried some inches into the oak, with
the handle upmost, it having turned round in its
flight.</p>

<p class="indent">This is analogous to the custom of the Portuguese,
who, in throwing the knife, always project
it with the handle foremost, but it as uniformly
strikes with the point.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
These Socs or Sacs were the only genuine unadulterated
Indians I ever saw. They were very
fine men, few of them under six feet high, and
their symmetry perfectly faultless. In action they
fought all but naked, which gymnastic undressing
gave you the means of seeing their forms to the
greatest advantage.</p>

<p class="indent">Their features, too, had not the rounded form
or stolid expression of many Indian tribes, particularly
those towards the North. They had
European features, or, more properly, those of
the Asiatic. Their Chief had so strong a resemblance
to George the Third that even the tribe
called the head on the half penny Mautass, and
he certainly might have passed for a bronze
statue of that worthy and estimable Monarch.</p>

<p class="indent">After the action was over, and it was drawing
towards dusk, I rapidly traversed the ground
with a strong party to look out for wounded,
and finding only a few of the enemy, I ordered
them to be carried to the hospital, but I preceded
them to make preparations for their reception.
When nearing the Camp, I found a party
of the band of our Regiment carrying in a blanket
an American officer mortally wounded, who was
greedily drinking water from one of the soldier&#39;s
canteens. I ordered them to lay him down, and
set myself to dress his wound. He calmly said,
"Doctor, it&#39;s all in vain&mdash;my wound is mortal,
and no human skill can help me&mdash;leave me here
with a canteen of water near me, and save yourself&mdash;you
are surrounded, and your only chance
of escape is to take to the woods in a northerly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
direction, and then make your way east for
Queenston,&mdash;there is not a man of your army
who can escape by any other means&mdash;I am not at
liberty to tell you more." I, however, ordered
the men to carry him to a hut belonging to an
officer of my own Regiment, who undertook to
sit by him till my return. After he had been put
to bed I left him, and when I returned during
the night from my hospital, he was dead. He
proved to be Colonel Wood of the American Engineers&mdash;a
man equally admired for his talents
and revered for his virtues. His calmness and
courage in the hour of death, with his benevolence
and kindness to myself and others, who
were doing any little they could to render his
last moments easy, convinced me that he deserved
the high character which all his brother officers
that I afterwards met with uniformly gave
him.</p>

<p class="indent">Next morning I discovered what the poor Colonel
alluded to. The party sent down the right
bank of the Niagara to take us in rear, on arriving
at the place where it was determined they
should cross, saw a body of troops cooking their
dinners on the bank, and supposing their plan
was betrayed, desisted from the attempt.</p>

<p class="indent">The fact was, it was a party of men coming up
to join their Regiments in the field, who had
halted there by chance, and by this accident we
were saved, for had a small force landed they
must have taken our baggage, ammunition and
field guns (for the camp was deserted except by
the few guards that were mounted more for show
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
than use), and had they attacked us in rear,
must have thrown us into inextricable confusion.
I could now see well enough why the enemy were
so easily driven in. Had the expected attack on
our rear taken place, there is no doubt they
would been out again in double their former
force; but they had done all that there was any
necessity for them to do&mdash;they had brought us
into a general engagement, made us leave our
camp and park of artillery undefended, and had
their other column made the proposed attack in
rear, their loss, severe as it was under existing
circumstances, would have been of no account,
compared to the advantages that must have accrued
from it.</p>

<p class="indent">We continued this <i>humbugging</i> kind of warfare
for some time longer, when, finding there was no
chance of us breaching strong ramparts, or
knocking down stone towers with such artillery
as we had to apply, and under the direction of
such engineers as it pleased the Lord in His
wrath to bestow upon us, it was determined to
try the matter by a <i>coup de main</i>. Accordingly
about a week before the great attempt was to
be made, it was known in the camp, from the
General to the drum-boy, that it was in contemplation.
A worthy old officer of De Watteville&#39;s
used to salute his friends every morning
with&mdash;"Well, gentlemans! this would be one very
fine day for <i>de grand object</i>." As the intelligence
was so universal in our camp, it is not well supposable
that it should be unknown in that of the
enemy, and accordingly they had a full week to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
prepare for our attack. At last orders were given
for the assault. It was to be made in two
divisions, one against the Fort, and another
against Snake hill, a fortified camp higher up the
lake. The troops at sun-set moved on, but before
we had started half an hour an express was sent
after us to recall us. Had the enemy had the
slightest doubt of the information their spies and
our deserters had given them as to our intentions,
this must have set it at rest. Some three
days after we had orders in form to make the
attack, and our brigade was to lead. Never were
men better pleased than ours were to hear this.
We were tired of the wet bivouac they called a
camp; we were tired of our busy idleness! which,
though fatal to many of our comrades, had as
yet produced no military result; and we knew
that whatever they might be at a distance, the
enemy had no chance with us at a hand-to-hand
fight, and therefore we hailed the prospect of an
assault as a relief from trouble&mdash;a glorious termination
to a fatiguing and harassing campaign,
where, if we had got some credit by the Battle of
the Falls, accounts from that date to the present
had been pretty evenly balanced.</p>

<p class="indent">I have said that it was determined that our
brigade should lead, and never was honor more
highly appreciated. It struck us that the General
showed great discrimination and penetration
in selecting the very fittest men under his command
for such a service, the more so that the
corps of flank companies to which I belonged,
was to lead immediately after the forlorn hope.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
We were the first for duty on that day, and the
relief brigade was summoned out at eleven and
marched to take up its position at twelve. We
breakfasted at eight; Colonel Drummond was in
high spirits&mdash;it has sometimes struck me since
unnaturally high,&mdash;but that idea might have proceeded
from the result. Be that as it may, certain
it is that he had a presentiment that he
never would come out of that day&#39;s action, and
he made no secret of that feeling either from me
or several others of his friends.</p>

<p class="indent">We sat apparently by common consent long
after breakfast was over. Drummond told some
capital stories, which kept us in such a roar that
we seemed more like an after dinner than an
after breakfast party. At last the bugles sounded
the turn-out, and we rose to depart for our
stations; Drummond called us back, and his face
assuming an unwonted solemnity, he said, "Now
boys! we never will all meet together here
again; at least I will never again meet you. I
feel it and am certain of it; let us all shake
hands, and then every man to his duty, and I
know you all too well to suppose for a moment
that any of you will flinch it." We shook hands
accordingly, all round, and with a feeling very
different from what we had experienced for the
last two hours, fell into our places.</p>

<p class="indent">On taking up our several stations on piquet, the
weather, which had been clear became suddenly
dark and cloudy, and a thick, drizzling rain began
to fall, which, towards evening, increased to
a heavy shower. Colonel P., Colonel Drummond,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
and some more of us, were congregated in a hut,
anything but rain-tight; Colonel Drummond left
the hut, where we were smoking and talking, and
stowed himself away in a rocket case, where he
soon fell fast asleep. About midnight we were
summoned to fall in without noise, and a party
of sailors forming the forlorn hope, headed by a
midshipman taking the lead, our corps followed
close in their rear. When we were yet three hundred
yards from the fort their videttes fired on
us and immediately retired; soon after the guns
of the Fort opened, but with little or no effect.
About 200 yards from the fort Drummond halted,
and turning to me unbuckled his sword, which
he gave to me, telling me to keep it for his sake.
It was a regulation sword in a steel scabbard.
Thinking that he had no great faith in it, I offered
him mine, which was a Ferrara of admirable
temper and edge; but he said he had got a
boarding pike from the sailors whom he was going
to join. He told me to stand where I was
and not expose myself; and these were the last
words I ever heard him utter.</p>

<p class="indent">The sailors and our corps dashed on and made
good their lodgment in fine style, and after standing
till the last of the attacking columns was
past, I began to feel my situation most particularly
unpleasant. A man must possess more
courage than I can pretend to, who can stand
perfectly cool, while, having nothing to do, he is
shot at like a target. Accordingly, I determined
to advance at all hazards, and at least have the
pleasure of seeing what was doing for my risk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
of being shot. I had not proceeded many yards
when I stumbled over a body, and on feeling, for
I could not see, I discovered he was wounded in
the arm and the blood flowing copiously. He
had fainted and fallen in attempting to get to
the rear. I fixed a field tourniquet on his arm,
and throwing him over my shoulder like a sack,
carried him to a ravine in rear, and delivered him
to the care of a Naval Surgeon I met with there.
He proved to be Major R. of the Royals, who,
but for my lucky stumble, would most probably
have given promotion to the senior Captain of
that distinguished Regiment.</p>

<p class="indent">When I came up to the fort I found no difficulty
in getting on the rampart, for our own men
were in full possession; but just as I was scrambling
over some dead bodies, an explosion took
place. At first I thought it was a shell had
burst close to me, for the noise was not greater
if so great, as that of a large shell; but the tremendous
glare of light and falling of beams and
rubbish soon demonstrated that it was something
more serious. In a fact a magazine in a bastion
had exploded, and on the top of this bastion,
through some mistake of their orders, the 103rd
Regiment were either posted or scrambling up;
all who were on the top were necessarily blown
up, and those not killed by the shock fell on the
fixed bayonets of their comrades in the ditch,
and thus, after we were in possession of the
place, in one instant the greater part of our force
was annihilated.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
All was now confusion, and&mdash;d&mdash;l take the hindmost!
How I got across the ditch, I cannot,
nor never could call to my memory; but I found
myself scouring along the road at the top of my
speed, with a running accompaniment of grape,
cannister and musketry whistling about my ears,
and tearing the ground at my feet.</p>

<p class="indent">When about half way between the ditch and the
ravine, I heard a voice calling on me for help.
I found it was a wounded officer; so, calling a
drum-boy of the Royals, who had a stretcher, we
laid him into it, and carried him after the manner
of a hand-barrow; he entreated us to get
into the wood, as, on the road, we were likely to
be cut to pieces with the shot. Accordingly we
turned for that purpose; but just as we were entering,
a round shot cut a large bough just above
our heads, and down it came on the top of the
three of us. I crawled backwards and the drum-boy
forwards; and there we were staring at
each other; however, there was no time to express
our surprise. I ordered him in again, and
I crawled in at the other side; and by our joint
exertions we got the poor fellow out of his uncomfortable
situation, and once in the wood we
were safe for the rest of our journey. I handed
him over to some medical men in the battery,
and went in search of my own men.</p>

<p class="indent">Day not being yet fairly broken, I did not
know whom I had been the means of saving, but
more than twelve months after I met in the
streets of Portsmouth with Captain C., of the
103rd, who, after shaking hands with me, thanked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
me for my kindness to him at Fort Erie, and
this was the first time that I ever knew the Regiment
to which my man belonged, for in the imperfect
light I thought he had dark facings. On
my arrival in the battery there was a scene of
sad confusion. Sir Gordon Drummond was with
great coolness forming the men as they came in,
and I, with others, set to work to assist him.
Without regard to what corps they belonged, we
stuck them behind the breast-work, anticipating
an attack. Sir Gordon asked me what officers
were killed; I told him all that I knew of, and
when I mentioned Colonel Drummond of Keltie,
and Colonel Scott, of Brotherton, (both like himself,
Perthshire lairds, and neighbors of his,) he
seemed deeply affected.</p>

<p class="indent">I sent poor Drummond&#39;s sword, by his servant,
to his family, and reserved for a memorial, a
string of wampum beads which he had got from
the Indians, with whom he was an especial favourite.
This I wore round my neck six years
afterwards in 1820, at the Cape of Good Hope,
when his brother, being Field Officer of the day,
riding past me observed it, and asked a gentleman
who had come from India in the same ship
with me the cause of my wearing so extraordinary
an ornament. On being told, he waited on
me, and as I was the first person he had met
with who had been present when his brother fell,
he heard from me the circumstances I have here
related.</p>

<p class="indent">After this it was quite clear that we could get
no good by remaining, as we had failed in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
main object of the campaign. But remain
we did for some time, having an occasional
skirmish with the enemy, but nothing decisive.
At last it was determined that we should retire
behind the Chippawa; this we accordingly did,
unfollowed by the enemy, who, when they saw us
fairly gone, took themselves across the river,
abandoning the fort they had defended so obstinately
for three months; in fact it had served all
their purposes, which evidently were to keep us
busy as long as we could keep the field, preventing
us doing mischief on their side by amusing us
on our own.</p>

<p class="indent">After the blow up, our little corps was broken
up, and the companies composing it joined their
respective battalions. My own regiment was
wretchedly reduced; little more than three
months before it had gone into the Battle of the
Falls, five hundred strong, with a full complement
of officers. Now we retired about sixty
rank and file, commanded by a Captain, two of
the senior Lieutenants carrying the colours, and
myself marching in rear&mdash;<i>voilá</i>, His Majesty&#39;s
89th Regiment of Foot!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p class="indent">We took up our ground on the left bank of the
Chippawa, in the hope that we would be attacked
in that strong position; but nothing was
further from the intention of the enemy than
such a flagrant absurdity. They, from time to
time, sent small parties to look at us; and there
was some very distant skirmishing, which proved
very harmless amusement; but they withdrew
at last, and we were ordered into winter
quarters.</p>

<p class="indent">Our regiment, with the 100th, took up their
quarters at Queenston, where we were soon
strengthened by the recovered wounded and sick
from the different hospitals. We were particularly
happy in a commanding officer. The then
young and handsome Marquis of Tweeddale, who
was Lieutenant Colonel of the 100th, commanded
our brigade: he had been educated in a good
school, under the "Great Duke;" and, like his
master, with an unceasing regard to the essentials
of the service, he had a most sovereign
contempt for those adventitious parts of it, which
weaker minds are apt to consider as of the highest
importance. Should his lordship, in the present
high and responsible situation which he occupies,
have an opportunity of displaying his talents,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
I am much deceived if he will not add one
more to the numerous band of soldiers who have
raised their own and their country&#39;s name in the
fields of Hindostan; therefore, God send him a
good <i>war</i>! I have no great faith in him as a
politician: he is too honest a man!</p>

<p class="indent">But whatever he may be, as a soldier or a
statesman, he was a wretched bad patient; for he
was wounded, in a way that I had every fear
would result in a permanent lameness; and nothing
could save him but rest. I recommended
him, therefore, to spend most of his time on a
bed&mdash;for sofas were rather scarce in Queenston at
that time;&mdash;but he persisted in riding a pony,
with a crutch over his shoulder. Whether his mode
of management has induced lameness or not, I do
not know, for I have never seen him since; but
if he is lame, it is no fault of mine.</p>

<p class="indent">Queenston, though in ruins, having, like all the
rest of the frontier, been wantonly destroyed by
the enemy, was then, as it is now, a very prettily-situated
village; and the rest our men obtained,
after their severe fatigues, began to have
a most salutary effect upon them, so, as my
senior colleague had recovered to such an extent
as to attend to the diminished duties of the
regimental hospital there, I was despatched to
York&mdash;now Toronto&mdash;to take charge of about
thirty of my own men, who were in general hospital
in that garrison.</p>

<p class="indent">Toronto was then a dirty straggling village,
containing about sixty houses. The church&mdash;the
only one&mdash;was converted into a general hospital,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
and I formed my lodge in the wing of the Parliament
buildings, which had escaped, when the
Americans had burnt the rest of that fabric.</p>

<p class="indent">Our accommodations were comfortable, by
comparison with what we had lately been obliged
to put up with. At all events, we had a tight
roof over our heads, a clean floor under our feet,
and the means of fire enough to keep us warm;
and a soldier who is not content with this, on a
campaign, deserves to want. My own regiment
soon came down to form a part of the garrison
of Toronto; and there I remained till the month
of December, 1814.</p>

<p class="indent">At this time, it was proposed to build a large
ship on Lake Huron&mdash;we having then so many on
Lake Erie&mdash;that would be able, from her size,
and the weight of her metal, to cope with the
small vessels that composed the American flotilla
on Lake Erie. As there is a channel through
Lake Saint Clair, and the Rivers Detroit and
Saint Clair, by which she could pass from the
one lake into the other, an inlet, called Penetanguishene,
was selected as the proper site of a
new dock-yard, and a better sight could hardly
have been selected, in this, or any other, part of
the world. It was a narrow-mouthed, deep bay,
with plenty of water for any size of craft, and a
fine bold shore, easily defensible against any
ships that could approach; but unluckily, at this
time, Penetanguishene was in the woods, thirty
miles from Lake Simcoe; and before a ship of
the line could be built, a road must be cut, and
stones broke along it.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
This, at mid-winter, in one of the northernmost
points of Canada, was no easy matter. But
when Government, in the time of war, determine
on a measure, the word impossible, as we used to
say in the army, is not to be found in Dundas&mdash;and
done it must be.</p>

<p class="indent">Accordingly, in the early part of December, I
volunteered my services, and, as nobody else
envied the job, they were accepted; and a company
of the Canadian Fencibles, with about the
same number of militia, under the direction of
Colonel Cockburn, of the Quarter Master General&#39;s
Department, was despatched up to the north,
with instructions to have the road cut at all hazards.</p>

<p class="indent">When we arrived on the banks of Lake Simcoe,
we found it just in such a state that it could not
possibly be crossed; for the ice was formed, so
that a boat could not get through it, but not
strong enough to bear a man&#39;s weight. But, as
there was a keen frost, we knew that this obstacle
would soon be overcome; so we took up our
quarters in farm-houses along the margin of the
lake.</p>

<p class="indent">In two days it was considered practicable to
cross, and I volunteered to try it. I equipped
myself with a long pole, with a chisel at the end
of it, to try the ice with, and an axe slung across
my shoulder, and skated across, about twelve
miles.</p>

<p class="indent">The ice, though not very thick, was good, and
quite sufficient to bear men at extended order;
so, on my return, I reported it practicable. Next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
morning the men were drawn out at the point
at which it was considered the most eligible for
getting on the ice; but the moment we were
ready to start, a noise, like that of very loud
thunder, was heard, which ran round the lake,
and across it; and, in an inconceivably short
time, the whole ice was broken into fragments,
some of some acres in extent, others of only a
few yards. What the cause of this phenomenon
could be, I never could form even a probable conjecture
of, for there was no visible rise or fall of
the water; but I was told, by the inhabitants of
the neighborhood, that they had more than once
seen the same thing before.</p>

<p class="indent">The question now arose what was to be done
next? The country people recommended that
we should wait till next day, when not only
would the broken ice be re-united, but the water
which had risen upon it would be frozen into one
solid mass, rendering the whole twice as strong
as on the day previous, when I had passed it.</p>

<p class="indent">All this was undeniable, but the season was so
far advanced, and heavy snow storms might be
expected, so that even one day was of consequence.
After due deliberation, it was resolved,
that having a coil of rope with us, it should be
stretched along, and each take hold of it, and
drag his hand sleigh, on which was his knapsack
and provisions, as well as divers tools, implements,
and stores, requisite for the expedition.
In this guise we proceeded across the lake; the
disasters were numerous but none of them serious.
A fellow in stepping on a fracture of ice in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
the shape of the letter V, would plump in and
then be dragged out again by his comrades,
amidst shouts of laughter. In this mode we progressed
for upwards of six hours, until we reached
the opposite side, where a huge pile of logs
was kindled; a space swept clear of snow, and
we sat down to a late dinner. As the night appeared
clear, we scattered some hemlock boughs,
and raised a few of them to keep us from the
wind, but upon learning that the militia, who,
being from the neighborhood, had got over three
weeks before us, had left a regular shanty, within
a mile, we broke up our camp, and, deep as
the snow was, and late the hour, we proceeded
till we arrived at the spot, where trees were cut
down, a fire lighted, and we betook ourselves to
rest; our previous fatigue securing us from any
apprehension of a sleepless night.</p>

<p class="indent">Next day we started along the road the militia
had cut, and in two hours came up with them.
As they were sufficiently numerous for one party,
it was resolved that we should get on some
miles in advance of them, and commence further
up the line. The snow was about three feet deep,
and made the marching, heavy-laden as we were,
toilsome; but like Columbus&#39; egg, everything is
comparatively easy when people know how to go
about it. One mode of proceeding was this: six
or seven men led on snow shoes in Indian file,
taking care to tread down the snow equally;
then followed the column, also in Indian file.
At about every thirty yards, the leader of the
column stepped aside, and letting the rest pass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
him, fell into the rear. By this means, after the
fatigue of first breaking the snow, he could
march on a beaten path, and thus, alternating
labor and rest, the thing was comparatively
easy. By sun-set we had made about five miles
beyond the militia camp, and it was counted,
considering the road, a very fair day&#39;s journey.</p>

<p class="indent">It would be tiresome to detail (even if at this
distance of time I was able to do so), the journal
of a three months&#39; residence in the woods,
one day being an exact counterpart of another.
I shall, therefore, only mention the mode in
which we got on.</p>

<p class="indent">Our first care, on coming to our ground, was
to shovel away the snow, which latterly was six
feet deep; we then cut down as many bass-wood
trees (a species of the pine), as we required, and
then proceeded to erect our shanty, (<i>chantié</i>).
This was done by fixing four forked sticks in the
ground, the higher in front, from which we constructed
our roof. The bass-wood bark was peeled
and placed upon the roof, one layer lying in
the trough of the other, after the manner of a
tile. The trees were then split into rough boards,
which formed the back and sides of the mansion,
the front being open. The snow was then shovelled
up so as to render all secure. Hemlock
boughs were then strewed on the frozen ground,
and blankets and buffalo skins over that. In
front was a long fire, composed of six large logs,
three at the bottom, two upon these, and one on
the top, on the principle on which shot is piled
in a battery; in front, and within a yard of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
fire, was placed a log to prevent our feet being
scorched by the intense heat, and if, during the
night, our feet got cold, we had only to place
our heels on the top of the log, and in a few seconds
they were often more than comfortably
warm.</p>

<p class="indent">Two shanties were always placed opposite each
other, and this had a double advantage; they
sheltered the wind from each other, and one fire
did for both. In the case of the officers of the
party, their servants occupied the opposite one,
so they were always within call.</p>

<p class="indent">The labor of cutting the road in deep snow was
great, and the expense proportionately enormous.
Our provisions had to be carried in on men&#39;s
backs, for the snow had not been broken in time
enough to admit of horses or even oxen, so that
one half of our men were employed in carrying,
or, as it is technically termed, <i>packing</i> provisions
for the other. The want of oxen produced another
enormous source of expenditure; when a
log was cut it had to be drawn by drag ropes
out of the way, and thirty men could not perform,
in the deep snow, what a yoke of oxen
could easily have performed in light snow or
none at all. When the snow got very deep, too,
we had, before felling a tree, to dig a pit round
it of sufficient diameter to allow a man to stand
in it and swing his axe. The expense of a war
surprises John Bull, and he only grumbles; were
he to enquire into the causes, it is to be hoped
he would be shy of so expensive an amusement,
where after all he does not get his fun for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
money. I would undertake to-morrow to cut a
better road than we could possibly do, for forty
pounds a mile, and make money by it,&mdash;give me
timely warning and a proper season of the year,
whereas I am convinced that £2,500 to £3,000
did not pay for the one we cut.</p>

<p class="indent">Our amusements consisted in shooting partridges
and snaring the Canadian hare, which, as
it comes out of its hiding place chiefly at night,
can only be apprehended, as the game laws style
it, in that manner. The mode of so doing, being
caused by the necessities of the country, is
worthy of remark. These animals inhabit the
swamps, and make roads through the snow for
the purpose of coming out to where they can
browse. In these roads a spring is set, by bending
down a young sapling, and two pegs are
driven into the ground on each side of the path,
and notches are cut, in which a yoke is neatly
set, from which the noose hangs down, much on
the principle of a mole trap. The hare jerking
the wire, relieves the yoke, and the sapling resumes
its erect position, carrying the hare eight
or ten feet above the surface of the snow, and
this secures him from becoming the prey of the
wolf or the fox, who, if he was within their
reach, would inevitably secure him before his legitimate
captor arrived in the morning.</p>

<p class="indent">In this manner passed the winter, monotonously
enough it must be owned, but as we had full
employment we had no time to weary. When
we were about six or seven miles from the end
of our task, I started along the line to view the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
harbour. In Canada, the line is marked through
the forest by what is termed a Surveyor&#39;s <i>blaze</i>,
(a corruption of the French <i>balise</i>,) seeing that
boughs are stuck in the snow to guide travellers.
The blaze consists in marking the trees on the
line of the road with an axe, and except to a
practised eye, it is easily lost. I had proceeded
along it some miles, when a covey of partridges
crossed my path; I immediately followed them,
and after shooting several and losing sight of the
rest, I took off in the direction in which I thought
I should again cross the blaze. All my efforts
to find it, however, were unavailing, and as the
sun was fast declining, I had no other shift than
to go back on my own steps in the snow. I had
every motive to exertion, and about sun-set I
found myself about a mile and a quarter from
the camp; but it soon grew so dark that I could
trace my way no further. I therefore halted,
and having beat a path of about twenty yards
in length in the snow, I walked backward and
forward, determined to keep moving all night.
This resolution I kept for some hours, I believe,
but at last I got so sleepy that I could persevere
no longer, besides I felt that stupor coming over
me which makes men indifferent as to their fate.
I therefore determined to use my remaining energies
in giving myself every chance of life that
circumstances would admit of.</p>

<p class="indent">I took off my snow shoes, and poured a quantity
of rum into my moccasins; I buttoned my
jacket, secured my fur cap about my ears, drew
on my fur gloves, and calling a little dog I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
with me, and laying my hands over my face, I
made him lie on the top of all.</p>

<p class="indent">I slept most intensely sound, nor did I awake
till the morning sun was at least an hour high.
After two or three attempts I managed to rise;
my feet were frozen, and one of my hands slightly
so, but both were so benumbed that I could
not fasten on my snow shoes; I therefore had to
stick my toes in the holes of them, and shuffle
along as best I could. It had snowed about four
inches during the night, which was all in my favor.
I managed to scramble on towards the
camp, but could not manage more than quarter
of a mile an hour. On my arrival there, some
old French Canadians undertook the medical
treatment of my case. They stripped off my
moccasins and stockings, and commenced rubbing
my feet with snow. If there was any pain
in being frozen I was insensible to it, but of all
the tortures this world can devise, the resuscitation
was the worst I ever experienced. It was
that abominable sensation called tingling, in an
extreme degree, to such an extent, indeed, that
it more than once produced fainting, which unpleasant
symptom they combated by pouring
down my throat a tin cup full of rum. When
the pain abated, they enveloped my feet in poultices
of boiled beech leaves, which they conceive
"the sovereignest thing in life" in such cases.</p>

<p class="indent">I was confined to my bed for three weeks, and
then was only able to go abroad by swathing my
feet in numerous folds of blanket. In a few weeks
more I was as well as ever. The poor little dog,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
Moses, the companion of my sufferings, was not
so fortunate. He reached the camp with difficulty,
and died the next day.</p>

<p class="indent">I thought at the time and since, that this was
the only instance of a white man sleeping out in
a Canadian winter night, without fire or covering
of any kind, but whatever it might have been
then, we have had an instance here of a Canadian
French woman, who slept out under similar circumstances
two consecutive nights this winter.
She, however, did not get off so cheap as I did,
for she has been confined to bed for four months
and lost both her feet, and from the extent of
the injury it is probable she will be some months
yet before she is out of the doctor&#39;s hands.</p>

<p class="indent">It might be supposed that this kind of life
would generate disease, but the very reverse was
the case. In this, as well as all my other doings
in the woods, I have always found that where it
is possible to take proper care of the man, and
not expose them to wet, they are more healthy
than in quarters. It is only on military duty,
or with men who cannot or will not take care of
themselves, that disease takes place. I have
slept in the woods more than a year, at one
time and another, in the course of my life, and
with the foregoing provisos, never was better in
health or spirits under any circumstances. Except
casualties such as cutting feet, (a very common
accident, even among experienced choppers,)
and bruises from falling trees, I had not a single
case worth noticing on this expedition. I ascribe
this mainly to the beneficial effects of the open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
air on the constitution, a cause which, however
much has been said about it, seems yet not to be
practically understood by the generality of mankind.
Things went on pretty much the same till
we had nearly completed our business; no labour
had been spared in perfecting our work. Bridges
had been thrown across streams in the depth of
winter, when officers and men had to stand for
hours up the middle in ice-cold water: ravines
had to be bridged when the logs had to be dragged
out of swamps through four feet of snow.
The month of March was far advanced when we
promised ourselves a pleasant summer in the
comfortable quarters that we meant to build for
ourselves at Penetanguishene, when all our anticipations
were set aside by the arrival of the appalling
intelligence that peace had been concluded
between His Majesty and the United States. This
showed us half pay staring us in the face; however,
soldiers have nothing to do but obey&mdash;we
were withdrawn&mdash;all the expenditure incurred
went for nothing; we were marched to Toronto,
(then York,) and sent to join our respective regiments.</p>

<p class="indent">My regiment had marched down the country
on its way to embark for England; I followed it,
and after remaining for two months at Sorel,
embarked in June, 1815, to go to Waterloo, but
so many unnecessary delays had taken place,
that though we did not sail till the sixth of June,
we might quite as well have left Quebec on the
sixth May, in which case we should unquestionably
have figured in the greatest action of modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
times, and his grace, the great Duke, would
have been none the worse of from 15,000 to 20,000
of his veteran troops on whom he could depend.
It was fated otherwise, however; thank
God he managed to do without us. We heard of
his victory at sea, and a frigate was sent out to
order us to Portsmouth instead of Antwerp. We
were some of us sent to augment the Army of
Occupation in France, others to various quarters
at home, where, after spending eighteen months
to my own great satisfaction, but of which a
narration might not interest my readers, I was
placed on half-pay, and as I only propose to
treat of Canada, I shall leave in oblivion the memorabilia
of the next eleven and a half years,
and in my next chapter take up Canada as I
found it in 1826.</p>
